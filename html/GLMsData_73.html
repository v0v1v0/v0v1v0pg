<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data describe an experiment conducted to investigate
the amount of drug present in the liver of a rat.
Nineteen rats were randomly selected,
weighed,
and placed under a light anesthetic
and given an oral dose of the drug.
Because it was thought that large livers would absorb 
more of a given dose than a small liver,
the actual dose given was approximately determined as
40mg of the drug per kilogram of body weight.
After a fixed length of time,
each rat was sacrificed and the liver weighed,
and the percent dose in the liver was determined.
