<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Parameterizes a model for a collection of noisy time-series indexed by 
domain or observation unit as an additive function process plus 
noise process.  The latent functions are modeled under both
Gaussian process (GP) and intrinsic Gaussian Markov random (iGMRF) 
field priors.  Dependence is estimated among the set of functions by 
selecting a prior, G, on the covariance or precision
parameters of the GP and iGMRF, respectively, where G receives a 
Dirichlet process (DP) prior. The resulting marginal prior on the 
functions is a nonparametric scale mixture over the 
covariance or precision parameters, with G the unknown mixing measure.  
Draws from a DP are almost surely discrete, allowing for ties 
(interpreted as clusters) among the covariance or
precision parameters indexed by domain or observation unit.  
Functions are included that permit additional inference on the 
clustering properties over the domains. The mixture models 
allow specification of multiple additive latent functions for 
each of the GP and iGMRF DP mixture formulations. Each 
function (under a GP prior) may be specified with a covariance 
function selected from a set of available options that allow 
for combinations of trend and seasonal components.  
The same is true for precision matrix 
constructions under the iGMRF DP mixture.
</p>
<p>ESTIMATION FUNCTIONS
</p>
<p><code>gpdpgrow</code> performs Bayesian nonparametric estimation of a set of dependent, denoised
latent functions under a DP mixture of GP's in an unsupervised fashion based on user input of
an <code>N x T</code> data matrix, <code>y</code>, where <code>N</code> denotes the number of domains or units
and <code>T</code> denotes the number of time points.  The DP prior estimates the dependent structure 
among the covariance parameters generating each <code>T x 1</code> function across the <code>N</code> domains.
The user may specify multiple latent functions in an additive 
regression formulation, where
each covariance kernel may be selected from the squared exponential (<code>"se"</code>), the
rational quadratic (<code>"rq"</code>), or a quasi-periodic (product of a period and 
squared exponential
to allow the periodic kernel to evolve) (<code>"sn"</code>).
</p>
<p><code>gmrfdpgrow</code> also inputs an <code>N x T</code> data matrix, <code>y</code>, but replaces the 
GP prior used in <code>gpdpgrow()</code> with an iGMRF prior.  The DP mixture is over the precision 
parameter, <code>kappa</code>, that multiplies a fixed matrix, <code>Q</code>, which specifies 
the length-scale
of dependence.  The user may specify multiple functions in an additive formulation, 
each with its own precision matrix.  The precision matrix is specified 
via two options.  Input <code>q_type</code> 
indicates whether the precision matrix is a <em>trend</em>  (<code>"tr"</code>) 
precision matrix or a 
<em>seasonal</em> (<code>"sn"</code>) precision matrix. Integer innput <code>q_order</code> 
controls the length scale of the estimated functions and specifies the 
difference order of the precision matrix in the case of <code>q_type = "tr"</code>, 
or the periodicity, in the case <code>q_type = "sn"</code>.  Typically, <code>q_order</code> is set to
<code>1</code> or <code>2</code> when <code>q_type = "tr"</code>, though other values are possible.  An optional
<code>N x R</code> predictor matrix, ksi, may be input to adjust the prior for cluster assignments,
<code>s</code>, to produce a dependent product partition model.
</p>
<p><code>MSPE</code> Inputs a <code>gpdpgrow()</code> or <code>gmrfdpgrow()</code> object estimated where
some data values deliberately set to missing (<code>NA</code>) and produces an out-of-sample 
mean square prediction error (MSPE), and a normalized MSPE (normalized by the variance of
the missing test set). Both <code>gpdpgrow()</code> and <code>gmrfdpgrow()</code> returned objects also
include a leave-one-out log-pseudo marginal likelihood <code>LPML</code> fit statistic estimated
on the training set (so that no data are required to be left out).  One would expect the
<code>nMSPE</code> statistic to provide a greater penalty for model complexity since it is computed
on data not used for estimation.
</p>
<p><code>predict_functions</code> Uses the model-estimated GP covariance parameters from 
<code>gpdpgrow()</code> or iGMRF precision parameters from <code>gmrfdpgrow()</code>
to predict functions at <em>future</em> time points beyond the range of the data 
from their posterior predictive distributions. Both <code>gpdpgrow()</code> and <code>gmrfdpgrow()</code>
will predict missing function values in the range of the data.  
</p>
<p>PLOT FUNCTIONS
</p>
<p><code>cluster_plot</code> inputs a returned object from either of <code>gpdpgrow()</code> or
<code>gmrfdpgrow()</code> and produces two plots.  The first plot creates panels for the clusters
and aggregates line plots of posterior mean estimates for member denoised functions.  
An optional 
smoother may be drawn through the set of functions in each panel to differentiate the
patterns expressed across clusters.  A second plot renders the estimated posterior mean
values (with an option for credible intervals) for a single or group of randomly-selected
latent functions against the actual data values, <code>y</code>.
</p>
<p><code>informative_plot</code> inputs a list of returned objects, all from either
of <code>gpdpgrow()</code> or <code>gmrfdpgrow()</code> (where the model type, GP or 
iGMRF, is communicated with input <code>model</code>) that compares 
credible intervals for covariance or precision
parameters where the data are drawn from an informative 
sampling design (rather than as <em>iid</em>), so that the distribution 
for the population is not the same as that for
the sample.  One model conducts estimation in a fashion that ignores the informative
design and the other incorporates sampling weights to account for the informativeness.
Comparing the resulting estimated credible intervals provides a means to assess the 
sensitivity of estimated parameters to the sampling design.  The set of objects are
labeled with <code>objects_labels</code> with allowable inputs <code>c("ignore","weight","iid")</code>.
One of the objects must have label <code>"ignore"</code>, and the other must have label,
<code>weight</code>. An additional object may also be input that is estimated from an iid sample
drawn from the same population as the informative sample used for estimation under
objects <code>"ignore"</code> and <code>"weight"</code>.  Both informative and iid samples are generated
from the synthetic data function, <code>gen_informative_sample()</code>.
</p>
<p><code>fit_compare</code> inputs a list of returned objects, each from either
<code>gpdpgrow()</code> or <code>gmrfdpgrow()</code>, and plots the posterior mean estimate
for a randomly-selected latent function as compared to the actual data in a set
panels indexed by cluster and object.  Allows comparison of fit performance of
functions to data across varied model specifications.
</p>
<p><code>predict_plot</code> uses a returned object from <code>predict_functions()</code>
to plot both estimated and predicted function values (with the option for 
credible intervals) where the prediction interval is outside the range of data. 
The plot function, <code>cluster_plot</code>, should be used where 
the predicted values are in the range
of the data (and may, hence, be treated as missing values.  The estimated functions are
plotted in <code>cluster_plot</code> for the missing, as well as observed, data points).
</p>
<p>DATA SETS (and functions to generate synthetic data sets)
</p>
<p><code>cps</code> Data derived from the Current Population Survey (CPS) administered 
to households in
local areas within each of 51 states.  These data capture a rectangular matrix of 
monthly-indexed
all-other employment direct estimates computed from the set of household responses.  
The data capture
156 month observations (from 2000 - 2013) for each of the 51 states.  Two objects are included:
<code>y_raw</code> contains the 51 x 156 matrix of all-other employment counts.  
<code>y</code> contains the 51 x 156 matrix of all-other 
employment counts are standardization to (0,1), by state, to all
them to be modeled together.
</p>
<p><code>gen_informative_sample</code> Generates an <code>N x T</code> population data matrix, 
<code>y</code>, and an associated <code>n x T</code> sample data matrix, <code>y_obs</code>, where the 
sample is drawn using a 1 or 2-stage informative process.  The 1-stage sample uses
unequal probability stratified sampling, while the 2-stage process samples the first stage
in blocks, while the second stage samples with unequal probability from strata for selected
blocks.  Both block and strata memberships for population units are generated based on the
variance of their time-series, <code>y</code>.  The resulting sample is informative because the
block and cluster memberships and selection probabilities are determined based on <code>y</code>.
