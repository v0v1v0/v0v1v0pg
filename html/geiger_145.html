<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A list of nodes is returned, along with the number of lineages alive just before that node, the 
maximum number of descendents that any of those lineages has at the present day, a p-value for this
observation under the null hypothesis of a birth-death process (that is, given the null, what is the 
probability that one of these lineages had at least that many descendents), and the p-value after 
Bonferroni correction (given that a total of n-1 comparisons are made).
</p>
<p>If a plot is made, asterisks will mark significantly diverse clades.  These asterisks appear just 
to the right of the MRCA of the diverse clade.
</p>
<p>The Bonferroni correction used here is exceedingly conservative for a tree of any reasonable size (and not 
necessarily recommended, especially given the exploratory nature of this test and the non-independence of the comparisons). Plotting defaults to indicating which nodes are significant without a Bonferroni correction and a P-value of 0.05 as a cutoff (see <b>Examples</b> for modifying this behavior).
</p>
<p>One will often see significant results "trickle down" nodes in the tree - that is, if one clade is 
expecially diverse, then one or more of its parent clades will also be diverse.  The most 
parsimonious place to attribute this effect is to the most shallow significant branch - that is, 
the branch closest to the tips (see Moore et al. 2004).
