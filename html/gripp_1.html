<h2>Cost function</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This cost function is the one to be minimized using the Inverse Problem solver. It will need some information about the target and the direct problem.
<img src="../help/figures/Inverse_Problem_R_Solver_Cost.png" width="100%" alt="Figure: Inverse\_Problem\_R\_Solver\_Cost.png"></p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">cost(parm)</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>parm</code></td>
<td>
<p>Set of values to be considered as parameters for the Direct Problem solution</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Squared Difference between the target and the result that is calculated with the informed set of parameters 'parm'.</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">#
# Configure the name of the folder where each file with the parameter to be changed.
# If the folder is 'wd' then it will not be changed.
# You can change it to another location where your parameter files are.

#
# Configure the name of each file to be changed in the Direct Problem Solver.

#
# Configure the name of each parameter to be changed.
parm_name &lt;- c('A','B')
#
# Configure alternative method using line number to enter each parameter
# When line_number is zero, then the input method uses keywords.
line_number &lt;-c(0,0)
#
# Configure each parameter type, where:
#   1 means a numeric variable informed as a string, such as parm &lt;- "1.38"
#   2 means a numeric vector informed as a string of numbers separated with a space character.
#     For example, parm &lt;- "1.25 3.4". You must tell which one will be the variable considered.
parm_type &lt;- c(1,1)
#
# Informe the position of the variable to be considered in the problem in the vector.
# If the parameter is a numeric variable, then its position is zero.
parm_vector &lt;- c(0,0)
#
# Configure the name of the folder where the command must be called.
# If the folder is 'wd' then it will not be changed.
# You can change it to another location where your parameter files are.
command_folder &lt;- auxi
#
# This variable means that the Direct Problem is solved using R or outside
# if this is FALSE, the results are to be read from a file.
# When it is TRUE, results will be passed inside R using the variable "results"
isitR &lt;- TRUE
#
# Configure the command to be used to call the Direct Problem Solver.
command &lt;- 'f1.R'
#
# Configure the name of the file to be used as a target by the cost function.
# The file was built using parm &lt;- c(1,3).
# It is also a single column of values.
target &lt;- 'alvo.dat'
#
# Configure the name of the folder where the target file can be found.
# If the folder is 'wd' then it will not be changed.
# You can change it to another location where your target file is.

#
# Configure a string to be used to attrib values in the Direct Problem file.
attrib_str &lt;- '&lt;-'
#
# Configure the name of the file with the results obtained by the Direct Problem.
# It must be a single column of values.
# The results are changed at each run by the Direct Problem Solver.
result &lt;- 'result.dat'
#
# Configure the name of the folder where the results can be found after each run.
# If the folder is 'wd' then it will not be changed.
# You can change it to another location where your result file is.
