<h2>The age at which babies start to crawl</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The age at which babies start to crawl, 
the birth month and average monthly temperature six months after the birth month
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(crawl)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 12 observations on the following 5 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>BirthMonth</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>the baby's birth month; levels such as <code>January</code> and <code>July</code></p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Age</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>the mean age (in completed weeks) at which the babies born this month 
started to crawl; 
a numeric vector</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>SD</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>the standard deviation (in completed weeks) of the crawling ages 
for babies born this month; 
a numeric vector</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>SampleSize</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>the number of babies in the study born in the given month; 
a numeric vector</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Temp</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>the monthly average temperature (in degrees F) 
six months after the birth month; 
a numeric vector</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data come from a study which
hypothesized that babies would take longer to learn to crawl 
in colder months because the extra clothing restricts their movement.
From 1988–1991,
recorded were the babies' first crawling age and the average monthly temperature 
6 months after birth
(when “infants presumably enter the window of locomotor readiness”).
The parents reported the birth month,
and age when their baby first crept or crawled a distance 
of four feet in one minute. 
Data were collected at the University of Denver Infant Study Center 
on 208 boys and 206 girls,
and summarized by the birth month.
