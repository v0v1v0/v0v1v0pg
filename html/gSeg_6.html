<h2>Graph-Based Change-Point Detection</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package can be used to estimate change-points in a sequence of observations, where the observation can be a vector or a data object, e.g., a network.  A similarity graph is required.  It can be a minimum spanning tree, a minimum distance pairing, a nearest neighbor graph, or a graph based on domain knowledge.
</p>
<p>For sequence with no repeated observations, if you believe the sequence has at most one change point, the function <code>gseg1</code> should be used;  if you believe an interval of the sequence has a changed distribution, the function <code>gseg2</code> should be used.  If you feel the sequence has multiple change-points, you can use <code>gseg1</code> and <code>gseg2</code> multiple times. See <code>gseg1</code> and <code>gseg2</code> for the details of these two function.
</p>
<p>If you believe the sequence has repeated observations, the function <code>gseg1_discrete</code> should be used for single change-point. For a changed interval of the sequence, the function <code>gseg2_discrete</code> should be used. The function <code>nnl</code> can be used to construct the nearest neighbor link.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
data(Example)
# Five examples, each example is a n-length sequence.
# Ei (i=1,...,5): an edge matrix representing a similarity graph constructed on the
# observations in the ith sequence.  
# The following code shows how the Ei's were constructed.

require(ade4) 
# For illustration, we use 'mstree' in this package to construct the similarity graph.
# You can use other ways to construct the graph.

## Sequence 1: change in mean in the middle of the sequence.
d = 50
mu = 2
tau = 100
n = 200
set.seed(500)
y = rbind(matrix(rnorm(d*tau),tau), matrix(rnorm(d*(n-tau),mu/sqrt(d)), n-tau))
y.dist = dist(y)
E1 = mstree(y.dist)
# For illustration, we constructed the minimum spanning tree.
# You can use other ways to construct the graph.

r1 = gseg1(n,E1, statistics="all")  
# output results based on all four statistics
# the scan statistics can be found in r1$scanZ

r1_a = gseg1(n,E1, statistics="w")  
# output results based on the weighted edge-count statistic

r1_b = gseg1(n,E1, statistics=c("w","g"))  
# output results based on the weighted edge-count statistic 
# and generalized edge-count statistic

# image(as.matrix(y.dist))  
# run this if you would like to have some idea on the pairwise distance

## Sequence 2: change in mean away from the middle of the sequence.
d = 50
mu = 2
tau = 45
n = 200
set.seed(500)
y = rbind(matrix(rnorm(d*tau),tau), matrix(rnorm(d*(n-tau),mu/sqrt(d)), n-tau))
y.dist = dist(y)
E2 = mstree(y.dist)

## Sequence 3: change in both mean and variance away from the middle of the sequence.
d = 50
mu = 2
sigma=0.7

n = 200
set.seed(500)

set.seed(500)

y.dist = dist(y)
E4 = mstree(y.dist)

## Sequence 5: change in both mean and variance happens on an interval.

mu = 2
sigma=0.5
tau1 = 155
tau2 = 185

y.dist = dist(y)

## Sequence 6: change in mean away from the middle of the sequence 
## when data has repeated observations.

tau = 100
n = 200
set.seed(500)

y = rbind(y1, y2)
# Data y has repeated observations
