<h2>Crossover operation used by the TSP genetic algorithm</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Crossover operation used by the TSP genetic algorithm.  It takes
two tours and it computes two "offsprings" trying to exploit
the structure of the cycles, see below.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">crossover_tours(C1, C2, d, n)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>C1</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vertex numeric vector of the first parent tour.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>C2</code></td>
<td>
<p>Vertex numeric vector of the second parent tour.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>d</code></td>
<td>
<p>Distance matrix of the TSP instance.  It is used in the
computation of the low-weight perfect matching.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>The number of vertices of the TSP complete graph.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In the genetic algorithm, the crossover operation is a
generalization of local search in which two tours are combined
somehow to produce two tours, hopefully different from their
parents and with better fitting function values.  Crossover
widens the search while trying to keep the good peculiarities
of the parents.  However, in practice crossover almost never
lowers the fitting function when parents are near the optimum,
but it helps to explore new routes.  Therefore, it is always a
good idea to complement crossover with some deterministic
local search procedure which can find another local optima;
crossover also helps in evading local minima.
</p>
<p>In this routine, crossover is performed as follows.  Firstly, the
edges of the parents are combined in a single graph, and the
repeated edges are eliminated.  Then, the odd degree vertices
of the resulting graph are matched looking for a low-weight
perfect matching using a greedy algorithm.  Adding the
matching to the previous graph yields an Eulerian graph, as in
Christofides algorithm, whose final step leads to the first
offspring tour.  The second tour is constructed by recording
the second visit of each vertex by the Eulerian walk, and
completing the resulting partial tour with the nearest
neighbor heuristic.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A two-row matrix containing the two offsprings as vertex
numeric vectors.
