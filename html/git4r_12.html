<h2>Git Push</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Pushes just current branch to 'origin' by default, but allows selective
pushing of branches to different remotes if this is declined, for example
if you want to keep a test branch private.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">git_push(do_default = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>do_default</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character or logical passed as the answer to the interactive question
which is "push the current branch to origin". If 'Y' or TRUE, this function
runs without user input (used by <code>git()</code>), the default value <code>NULL</code> will
prompt the user to answer interactively.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>It is enforced that when pushing to 'origin' the branch is set to track this
remote branch. If the branch does not exist yet in the remote, it is not
pushed by default and must be manually added.
</p>
<p>Credentials are sorted in the same way for <code>git_pull()</code> and <code>git_push()</code>. If
<code>gitcreds</code> package is installed, this is used first to check whether the
system git installation already has a username / password for this host.
This can be changed or added using stand-alone git, or <code>gitcreds::gitcreds_set()</code>.
</p>
<p>Alternatively, if <code>gitcreds</code> is not installed, a system-git is not available,
or no existing git credentials are found, then the the environmental variables
are searched for a suitable Personal Access Token. The variable name must begin
<code>GIT_PAT</code> and any additional words are used to distinguish the PAT for the relevant
host using a closest-string match for the remote URL, for example
<code>GIT_PAT_AZURE=abc123def456</code> will be chosen to authenticate
an Azure DevOps remote above <code>GIT_PAT_GITHUB</code> or <code>GIT_PAT_GITLAB</code>.
</p>
<p>To set this up from scratch by creating a Personal Access Token and saving it
to your <code>.Renviron</code> file with the name "GIT_PAT****" where asterisks can be
replaced with part of the remote URL if you need to distinguish between several
different PATs (and a good reminder of what it is).
