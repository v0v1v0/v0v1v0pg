<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data record details about the Birth to Ten study (<abbr><span class="acronym">btt</span></abbr>), 
performed in the greater Johannesburg/Soweto metropolitan area
of South Africa during 1990. 
In the study,  
all mothers of singleton births were interviewed during a seven-week period
between April and June to women with permanent addresses 
in a defined area (a total of 4019 births). 
Five years later, 
964 of these mothers were re-interviewed. 
If the mothers interviewed later and representative of the original populations, 
the two groups should show similar characteristics. 
One of those characteristics is documented here: 
the proportion with and without medical aid.
