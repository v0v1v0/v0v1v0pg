<h2>Git Commit</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Make a commit checkpoint of the entire working directory except any changes which
have not been added, or files listed in <code>.gitignore</code>. Run <code>git_add()</code> immediately
before to confirm what changes are going to be included / excluded.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">git_commit(message = NULL, confirm_id = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>message</code></td>
<td>
<p>Commit message, usually one sentence about a specific change,
character atomic. This is asked for interactively if left NULL.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>confirm_id</code></td>
<td>
<p>Print out the current user identity which will be used for
the commit (this is always done for <code>git_pull()</code> )</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Commit messages are personal preference and many examples of good practice can
be found online. These messages should be useful for:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> informing yourself and others of what development choices have been made so far
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> searching for a particular change, for example like <code>git_history(message='bugfix 123')</code>
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> explaining a particular change for somebody else to review and accept
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>The current user identity (username and email) is printed to confirm who will
be tagged as making the commit. If this has not yet been configured, these
details are prompted interactively.
</p>
<p>Amending commits is not currently possible (see issue #213 for git2r) therefore
a commit message cannot be left blank.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Invisible NULL
