<h2>Smoothers available for backfitting</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Auxiliary function as user interface for 'gam' fitting. Lists what smoothers
are implemented, and allows users to include new smoothers.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">gam.smoothers(slist = c("s", "lo", "random"), wlist = c("s", "lo"))
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>slist</code></td>
<td>
<p>character vector giving names of smoothers available for
general backfitting. For every entry, eg "lo", there must exist a formula
function "lo()" that prepares the data, and a fitting function with the name
"gam.lo" which actually does the fitting. Look at "lo" and "s" as examples.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>wlist</code></td>
<td>
<p>character vector (subset of slist) giving names of smoothers
for which a special backfitting algorithm is available, when only that
smoother appears (multiple times) in the formula, along with other non
smooth terms.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a list is returned, consisting of the two named vectors. If the
function is called with no arguments, it gets the version of
"gam.smooth.list"' in the search path, by default from the package name
space. Once it is called with either of the arguments, it places a local
copy in the users namespace.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
## Not run: gam.smoothers()$slist # get the gam.smooth.list, and extract component slist
## Not run: gam.smoothers(slist=c("s","lo","random","tps") # add a new smoother "tps" to the list
