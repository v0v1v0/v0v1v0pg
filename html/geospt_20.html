graphs the probability or standardized variance in the directions north-south or east-west

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The pocket-plot (so named because of its use in detecting pockets
of non-stationarity) is a technique necessary to identify a localized
area that is atypical with respect to the stationarity model. It is built
to exploit the spatial nature of the data through the coordinates
of rows and columns (east "X" and north "Y", respectively).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">pocket.plot(data, graph, X, Y, Z, Iden=F, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>data frame should contain the dependent variable and coordinates X and Y, data must be gridded</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>graph</code></td>
<td>
<p>type of graph associated with the probability or standardized variance plot pocket in the directions north-south or east-west;
Probabilities PocketPlot by rows, ie horizontal "south-north" (PPR), Probabilities PocketPlot by columns, ie vertical "east-west" (PPC), 
PocketPlot of variance by rows, ie horizontal "south-north" (PVR) and PocketPlot of variance by columns, ie vertical "east-west" (PVC)</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>For identifying outliers, this function uses a modification of the boxplot.with.outlier.label function, available at 
<a href="https://www.r-statistics.com/2011/01/how-to-label-all-the-outliers-in-a-boxplot/">https://www.r-statistics.com/2011/01/how-to-label-all-the-outliers-in-a-boxplot/</a>
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>returns (or plots) the pocket plot

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Core measurements (in % coal ash) at reoriented locations. 
# Units on the vertical axis are % coal ash.

# These data was found in mining samples originally reported by 
# Gomez and Hazen (1970), and later used by Cressie (1993). 

# These data are available in the sp and gstat packages

# Pocket plot in the north-south direction. 
# Units on the vertical axis are root (% coal ash) 

# Plot generated with the function pocket.plot 
# Clearly rows 2, 6, and 8 are atypical 

# This serves as verification that these rows are potentially problematic

# Analysis of local stationarity in probabilities of the coal in south-north direction

# Analysis of local stationarity in probabilities of the coal in east-west direction
