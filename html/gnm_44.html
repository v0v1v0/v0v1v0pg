<h2>Defunct Functions in gnm Package</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The functions listed here are no longer part of gnm as they are not
needed any more. 
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">Nonlin(functionCall)
getModelFrame()
qrSolve(A, b, rank = NULL, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>Nonlin</code> is not needed any more as
the plug-in architecture has been replaced by functions of class
<code>"nonlin"</code>, see <code>nonlin.function</code>.
</p>
<p><code>getModelFrame</code> was designed to work from within a plug-in
function so is no longer needed.
</p>
<p><code>qrSolve</code> was a function to solve the linear system Ax = b by two
applications of QR decomposition. Alternative methods were found to be
more robust.
