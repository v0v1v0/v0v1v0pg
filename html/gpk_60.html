<h2>
Species abundance distribution
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>4. One approach to biodiversity measurement is fitting a distribution to species abundance data. In the present case data on abundance of different species is recorded at two Indian localities in western-ghats (Arvind and Dhoni). These data are said to be 'Frequency of frequency'.
Here 14 species were encountered only once. There were 9 species such that exactly two individuals of each species were seen etc.
Some ecological considerations suggest that a log-series distribution should fit the data. Parameter of the log-series distribution (called Fisher's $alpha$) is taken as indicator of diversity. Higher the value of parameter, higher is the diversity.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(Logseriesbirds)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 179 observations on the following 3 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>Site</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The site</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Abundance</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The number of individual birds sighted</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Species</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>The number of species with abundance r each</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Fitting Log-series distribution and Chi-square test for Goodness of fit are appropriate tools for this data set.
