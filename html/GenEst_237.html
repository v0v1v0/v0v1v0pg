<h2>Trough-based solar thermal power simulated example</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An example data set for estimating fatalities from a trough-based solar 
thermal electric power generation facility.  The simulated site is inspected 
daily along ten 2000 meter long transects,  which run  north-south. Observers
look up to 150 meters away down the rows created by troughs  (east-west).  
One sided distance sampling will be used, with observers looking consistently
in  one cardinal direction as they travel through the facility. A sitewide 
clearout search is implemented before the first scheduled winter search.
</p>
<p>The dataset consists of five parts: Data on carcass observations (CO) from 
daily searches, field trials for estimating carcass persistence (CP) and 
searcher efficiency (SE), search schedule (SS), and density weighted 
proportion (DWP) of area searched for the rows within each transect (which is
an area adjustment factor to account for incomplete search coverage).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">solar_trough
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p><code>solar_trough</code> is a list with 5 elements:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>SE</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Searcher efficiency trial data</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>CP</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Carcass persistence trial data</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>SS</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Search schedule parameters</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>DWP</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Density weighted proportion of area searched</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>CO</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Carcass observations</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Searcher Efficiency (<code>SE</code>)</h3>

<p><code>$SE</code> is a data frame with each row representing the fate of a single
carcass in the searcher efficiency trials. There are columns for:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>Season</code></dt>
<dd>
<p><code>"winter"</code>, <code>"spring"</code>, <code>"summer"</code>, or 
<code>"fall"</code></p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Size</code></dt>
<dd>
<p><code>"bat"</code>; or <code>"lrg"</code>, <code>"med"</code>, or 
<code>"sml"</code> bird</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>"Search1",...,"Search5"</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>fate of carcass on the 1st, 2nd, 3rd,
4th, and 5th search after placement. A value of 1 implies that a carcass 
was discovered by searchers, 0 implies the carcass was present but not
discovered, and any other value is interpreted as "no search" or
"carcass not present" and ignored in the model. In this data set,
<code>NA</code> indicates that a carcass had been previously discovered and
removed from the field. A user may use a variety of values to
differentiate different reasons no search was conducted or the carcass
was not present. For example, "NS" to indicate the search
was not scheduled in that location at that time, or "SC" to indicate the
carcass had been removed by scavengers prior to the search.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Distance</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>the distance a carcass was placed from the 
observer's transect.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Carcass Persistence (<code>CP</code>)</h3>

<p><code>$CP</code> is a data frame with each row representing the fate of a single
carcass in the carcass persistence trials. There are columns for:
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>Index</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>unique ID for each carcass</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Season</code></dt>
<dd>
<p><code>"winter"</code>, <code>"spring"</code>, <code>"summer"</code>, or 
<code>"fall"</code></p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Size</code></dt>
<dd>
<p><code>"bat"</code>; or <code>"lrg"</code>, <code>"med"</code>, or 
<code>"sml"</code> bird</p>
</dd>
<dt>
<code>LastPresent</code>, <code>FirstAbsent</code>
</dt>
<dd>
<p>endpoints of the interval bracketing the
time the carcass was scavenged or otherwise removed from the field. For 
example, <code>LastPresent = 2.04</code>, <code>FirstAbsent = 3.21</code> indicates that the carcass
was last observed 2.04 days after being placed in the field and was noted 
missing 3.21 days after being placed. If the precise time of carcass 
removal is known (e.g., recorded by camera), then <code>LastPresent</code> and
<code>FirstAbsent</code> should be set equal to each other. If a carcass persists
beyond the last day of the field trial, <code>LastPresent</code> is the last time it was
observed and <code>FirstAbsent</code> is entered as <code>Inf</code> or <code>NA</code>.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Search Schedule (<code>SS</code>)</h3>

<p><code>$SS</code> is a data frame with a row for each date a transect at the site 
was searched, a column of <code>SearchDate</code>s, and a column for each 
transect. In addition, there is an optional column to indicate the 
<code>Season</code>. The columns for distinct area (array) and the date column
are required, and the names of the columns for search areas must match the 
names of areas used in the DWP and CO files.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>SearchDate</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>columns of dates when a transect was searched. 
Format in this data is <code>"%Y-%m-%d CDT"</code>, but time zone (<code>CDT</code>)
is optional. A time stamp may be included if desired (e.g., 
<code>2018-03-20 02:15:41</code>). Alternatively, <code>\</code> can be used in
place of <code>-</code>.</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Season</code></dt>
<dd>
<p><code>"winter"</code>, <code>"spring"</code>, <code>"summer"</code>, or 
<code>"fall"</code> to indicate which season the search was conducted in. 
<code>Season</code> is optional but may be used as a temporal covariate for 
fatality estimates.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Density Weighted Proportion (<code>DWP</code>)</h3>

<p><code>$DWP</code> is a data frame with a row for each transect and columns for 
each carcass size class (labels must match those of the class factors in the
carcass observation file). Values represent the density-weighted proportion
of the searched area for each size (or the fractionof carcasses that fall
in the searched area). Since the whole site was searched, DWP is uniformly
set equal to 1.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>Unit</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>unique ID for each transect.  IDs match those used in 
the <code>$CO</code> data frame and the column names in the <code>$SS</code> data.</p>

<dd>
<p>DWP associated with size class Bat</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>sml</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>DWP associated with size class Small</p>
