<h2>Download and Return a data.table Object of GSOD Weather Data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Automates downloading, cleaning, reformatting of data from the Global Surface
Summary of the Day (<abbr><span class="acronym">GSOD</span></abbr>) data provided by the
[US National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI)(https://www.ncei.noaa.gov/access/metadata/landing-page/bin/iso?id=gov.noaa.ncdc:C00516),
Three additional useful elements: saturation vapour pressure (es), actual
vapour pressure (ea) and relative humidity (RH) are calculated and returned
in the final data frame using the improved August-Roche-Magnus approximation
(Alduchov and Eskridge 1996).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">get_GSOD(
  years,
  station = NULL,
  country = NULL,
  max_missing = NULL,
  agroclimatology = FALSE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>years</code></td>
<td>
<p>Year(s) of weather data to download.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>station</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional.  Specify a station or multiple stations for which to
retrieve, check and clean weather data using <var>STATION</var>.  The
<abbr><span class="acronym">NCEI</span></abbr> reports years for which the data are available.  This function
checks against these years.  However, not all cases are properly documented
and in some cases files may not exist for download even though it is
indicated that data was recorded for the station for a particular year.  If a
station is specified that does not have an existing file on the server, this
function will silently fail and move on to existing files for download and
cleaning.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>country</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional.  Specify a country for which to retrieve weather
data; full name, 2 or 3 letter <abbr><span class="acronym">ISO</span></abbr> or 2 letter <abbr><span class="acronym">FIPS</span></abbr> codes
can be used.  All stations within the specified country will be returned.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>max_missing</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional.  The maximum number of days allowed to be
missing from a station's data before it is excluded from final file output.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>agroclimatology</code></td>
<td>
<p>Optional.  Logical.  Only clean data for stations
between latitudes 60 and -60 for agroclimatology work, defaults to <code>FALSE</code>.
Set to <code>TRUE</code> to include only stations within the confines of these
latitudes.</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>All units are converted to International System of Units (SI), <em>e.g</em>,
Fahrenheit to Celsius and inches to millimetres.
</p>
<p>Data summarise each year by station, which include vapour pressure and
relative humidity elements calculated from existing data in <abbr><span class="acronym">GSOD</span></abbr>.
</p>
<p>All missing values in resulting files are represented as <code>NA</code> regardless of
which field they occur in.
</p>
<p>For a complete list of the fields and description of the contents and units,
please refer to Appendix 1 in the <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=GSODR"><span class="pkg">GSODR</span></a> vignette,
<code>vignette("GSODR", package = "GSODR")</code>.

<p>A <code>data.table::data.table()</code> object of <abbr><span class="acronym">GSOD</span></abbr> weather data.

<h3>Note</h3>

<p><a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=GSODR"><span class="pkg">GSODR</span></a> attempts to validate year and station combination
requests, however, in certain cases the start and end date may encompass
years where no data is available.  In these cases no data will be returned.
It is suggested that the user check the latest data availability for the
station(s) desired using <code>get_inventory()</code> as this list is frequently
updated by the <abbr><span class="acronym">NCEI</span></abbr> and is not shipped with <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=GSODR"><span class="pkg">GSODR</span></a>.

the data should note the conditions that the U.S. <abbr><span class="acronym">NCEI</span></abbr> places upon
the <abbr><span class="acronym">GSOD</span></abbr> data.
