<p>This dataset was downloaded from <a href="http://www.stats.govt.nz/infoshare/">http://www.stats.govt.nz/infoshare/</a> and 
transformed in the following way:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> missing values were filtered out (ie of series that started later 
than the longest series)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> a 'Balance' indicator variable was added for easier manipulation and filtering
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> the single variable categorisation was split into two (Account
and Category) to make it tidier.
