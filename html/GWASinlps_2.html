<h2>Non-local prior based iterative variable selection for GWAS data, or other high-dimensional data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>GWASinlps</code> performs variable selection with data from Genome-wide association studies (GWAS), or other high-dimensional data with continuous, binary or survival outcomes, combining in an iterative framework, the computational efficiency of the structured screen-and-select variable selection strategy based on some association learning and the parsimonious uncertainty quantification provided by the use of non-local priors (see the References).
</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The GWASinlps method selects variables (SNPs) iteratively. 
</p>


<h4>For continuous response</h4>

<p>For continuous response (phenotype), the procedure starts with an initial set of independent variables (SNPs), a design matrix (SNP genotype matrix) <code>x</code> and a response (phenotype) vector <code>y</code>. 
</p>
<p>- An iteration proceeds by determining the <code>k0</code> <em>leading SNPs/variables</em> having the highest association with <code>y</code>. The measure of association is the absolute value of the Pearson's correlation coefficient <code>cor_xy</code>. These <code>k0</code> leading SNPs/variables, in turn, determine <code>k0</code> <em>leading sets</em>, where each leading set consists of all SNPs/variables with absolute correlation coefficient more than or equal to <code>rxx</code> with the correspondng leading SNP/variable.
</p>
<p>- Within each leading set, non-local prior based Bayesian variable selection for linear models is performed (using package <span class="pkg">mombf</span>). The variables (SNPs) appearing in the highest posterior probability model (HPPM) are considered selected in the current iteration. Note that a single variable (SNP) can be selected from multiple leading sets. The selected variables (SNPs) are regressed out from <code>y</code> using <code>lm</code> fit. The variables (SNPs) that are included in one or more of the <em>leading sets</em> but do not appear in any HPPM are dropped from further analysis. 
</p>
<p>- With updated <code>y</code> and variable (SNP) set, next iteration proceeds similarly. And so on like this. The procedure continues until the stopping point, which is determined by the GWASinlps tuning parameters <code>m</code>, <code>rxx</code>, and <code>nskip</code>, is reached. For more details, see References.
</p>



<h4>For binary response</h4>

<p>For binary response (phenotype), the procedure starts with an initial set of variables (SNPs), a design matrix (SNP genotype matrix) <code>x</code> and a binary response (phenotype) vector <code>y</code>. If <code>method="rigorous"</code>,
</p>
<p>- The first iteration proceeds by determining the <code>k0</code> <em>leading SNPs/variables</em> having the highest association with <code>y</code>. The measure of association is the absolute value of the maximum marginal likelihood estimate <code>mmle_xy</code>. These <code>k0</code> leading SNPs/variables, in turn, determine <code>k0</code> <em>leading sets</em>, where each leading set consists of all SNPs/variables with absolute correlation coefficient more than or equal to <code>rxx</code> with the correspondng leading SNP. 
</p>
<p>- Within each leading set, non-local prior based Bayesian variable selection for logistic regression model is performed (using package <span class="pkg">mombf</span>). The variables (SNPs) appearing in the HPPM are considered selected in the first iteration. Note that a single variable (SNP) can be selected from multiple leading sets. The variables (SNPs) which are included in one or more <em>leading sets</em> but do not appear in any HPPM are dropped from further analysis. After this, the selected variables (SNPs) are accounted for by including them in <code>glm</code> fits of <code>y</code> with each of the remaining variables (SNPs). The <code>glm</code> coefficients of the remaining variables, thus obtained, reflect their contribution in presence of the selected variables (SNPs) of the first iteration. 
</p>
<p>- Considering the absolute values of these <code>glm</code> coefficients as the measure of association, we proceed with the second iteration with updated variable (SNP) set. And so on in this manner. The procedure continues until the stopping point, which is determined by the GWASinlps tuning parameters <code>m</code>, <code>rxx</code>, and <code>nskip</code>, is reached.
</p>
<p>If <code>method="quick"</code>, the procedure is similar to above except at the following points. In this method, non-local prior based Bayesian variable selection using logistic regression model is performed until one or more variables (SNP) are selected in an iteration. Until a variable is selected, there is no need to account for anything, so the initial maximum marginal likelihood estimates continue to be used. After the first selections (if any) are made, a <code>glm</code> fit of <code>y</code> on the selected variables is performed and the deviance residuals are computed. In the subsequent iterations, considering these (continuous) deviance residuals as response, non-local prior based Bayesian variable selection for linear models is performed till the stopping point is reached.
</p>



<h4>For survival data</h4>

<p>For survival data, the procedure starts with an initial set of variables (SNPs), a design matrix (SNP genotype matrix) <code>x</code> and a binary response (phenotype) vector <code>y</code>. 
</p>
<p>- The first iteration proceeds by determining the <code>k0</code> <em>leading SNPs/variables</em> having the highest association with <code>y</code>. The measure of association is the absolute value of the marginal utility <code>mu_xy</code>. These <code>k0</code> leading SNPs/variables, in turn, determine <code>k0</code> <em>leading sets</em>, where each leading set consists of all SNPs with absolute correlation coefficient more than or equal to <code>rxx</code> with the correspondng leading SNP. 
</p>
<p>- Within each leading set, non-local prior based Bayesian variable selection for accelerated failure time model is performed (using package <span class="pkg">mombf</span>). The variables (SNPs) appearing in the HPPM are considered selected in the first iteration. Note that a single variable (SNP) can be selected from multiple leading sets. The variables (SNPs) which are included in one or more <em>leading sets</em> but do not appear in any HPPM are dropped from further analysis. After this, to account for the selected variables (SNPs), conditional utilities of each of the remaining variables (SNPs) are computed in the presence of the selected variables (SNPs) in the model. These conditional utilities reflect the contribution of the remaining variables (SNPs) in presence of the selected variables (SNPs) of the first iteration. 
</p>
<p>- Considering the absolute values of these conditional utilities as the measure of association, we proceed with the second iteration with updated variable (SNP) set. And so on in this manner. The procedure continues until the stopping point, which is determined by the GWASinlps tuning parameters <code>m</code>, <code>rxx</code>, and <code>nskip</code>, is reached.
