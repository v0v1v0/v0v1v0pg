<h2>
Air-conditioning data
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These data, reported by Proschan (1963, Technometrics 5, 375-383), refer to the intervals, in service-hours, between failures of the air-conditioning equipment in a Boeing 720 aircraft. (Proschan reports data on 10 different aircraft. The data from only one of the aircraft is used here. Cox and Snell (1981, Applied Statistics: principles and examples, Chapman and Hall, London) discuss the analysis of the data on all 10 aircraft.)
The dataset consists of a single vector of data. They are used in the book ‘Distributions for location, scale and shape: Using GAMLSS in R’ to demonstrate the likelihood function and maximum likelihood estimation.
