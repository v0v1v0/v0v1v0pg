<h2>Run the GESLA Shiny app</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Run the GESLA Shiny app (geslaR-app) locally. The first
time this function is called, it will check if the GESLA dataset is
present. If not, it will prompt to download it or not. Please note
that the entire GESLA dataset is about 7GB in size, so make sure
there is enough space for it. The Shiny app will only work with the
entire dataset downloaded locally.
</p>
<p>Note, however, that the dataset needs to be downloaded only once, so
the next time this function is called, the app will open instantly.
</p>
<p>The same application is hosted in an online <a href="https://rstudio.maths.nuim.ie:3939/content/3258adf1-efbb-4996-9a8a-08a474639e8b/">server</a>,
with the exact same capabilities. The advantage of using the
interface locally is primarily because of its speed. If you don't
need the whole GESLA dataset and/or will only use a subset of it, we
recommend to use the online interface to filter the desired subset.
After that, you can use the <code>read_gesla()</code> function to
import it.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">run_gesla_app(
  app_dest = "./gesla_app",
  dest = paste0(app_dest, "/gesla_dataset"),
  overwrite = FALSE,
  open = TRUE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>app_dest</code></td>
<td>
<p>The destination directory that will host the app and
the database. It will be created if it doesn't exist. By default, it
will create a directory called <code>gesla_app</code> in the current working
directory.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dest</code></td>
<td>
<p>The destination directory that will host the GESLA
dataset files. By default, it will create a subdirectory under the
directory defined in <code>app_dest</code>. It's not recommended to change this
argument. If needed, change only the <code>app_dest</code> argument.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>overwrite</code></td>
<td>
<p>Overwrite the current dataset? If <code>TRUE</code> and called
on the same directory as the app, it will overwrite (i.e. download
again) the whole dataset. This is usually not necessary, unless the
dataset has really changed.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>open</code></td>
<td>
<p>Should the app open in the default browser? Defaults to
<code>TRUE</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The geslaR-app Shiny interface relies on a set of packages,
defined in the Suggests fiels of the package <code>DESCRIPTION</code> file.
When called for the first time, the function will check if all the
packages are available. If one or more are not installed, a message
will show which one of them should be installed. Alternatively, you
can install all of them at once by reinstalling the <code>geslaR</code> package
with <code>devtools::install_github("EireExtremes/geslaR", dependencies = TRUE)</code>. In this case, you will need to restart your R session.
</p>
<p>When downloading the GESLA dataset for the first time, it may take a
few minutes, since it depends on your internet connection and on the
traffic on an Amazon AWS server. Don't stop the process before it
ends completely. Note that this will be needed only the first time.
Once the dataset is downloaded, the other time this function is
called on the same directory, the interface should open in your
browser instantly.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The geslaR-app Shiny interface will open in your default
browser.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">if(interactive()) {
    ##------------------------------------------------------------------
    ## This will create a directory called `geslaR_app` on the current
    ## working directory and import the necessary files for the app.
    ## Also, it will create a subdirectory `gesla_app/gesla_dataset`,
    ## where the dataset will be downloaded.
    tmp &lt;- paste0(tempdir(), "/gesla_app")
    run_gesla_app(app_dest = tmp)

    ##------------------------------------------------------------------
    ## This function call on the same directory where the app is hosted,
    ## will overwrite the whole dataset (i.e. it will be downloaded
    ## again). A prompt for confirmation will be issued.
    run_gesla_app(app_dest = tmp, overwrite = TRUE)

    ## Remove files from temporary directory
    unlink(tmp, recursive = TRUE)
}
