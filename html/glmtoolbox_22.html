<h2>Shoulder Pain after Laparoscopic Cholecystectomy</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Inflation of the abdomen during laparoscopic
cholecystectomy (removal of the gallbladder) separates the liver from
the diaphragm and strains the attachments that connect both. This
strain is felt as a referred shoulder pain. Suction to remove residual
gas may reduce shoulder pain. There were 22 subjects randomized in the
active group (with abdominal suction) and 19 subjects randomized in
the control group (without abdominal suction). After laparoscopic
surgery, patients were asked to rate their shoulder pain on a visual
analog scale morning and afternoon for three days after the operation
(a total of six different times). The scale was coded into five
ordered categories where a pain score of 1 indicated "low pain" and
a score of 5 reflected "high pain".

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 246 rows and 7 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>id</dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector with the identifier of the patient.</p>
</dd>
<dt>treatment</dt>
<dd>
<p>a factor indicating the treatment received by the patient: abdominal suction ("A") and placebo ("P").</p>
</dd>
<dt>gender</dt>
<dd>
<p>a factor indicating the gender of the patient: female ("F") and male ("M").</p>
</dd>
<dt>age</dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector indicating the age of the patient, in years.</p>
</dd>
<dt>time</dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector indicating the occasion the patient was asked to rate their shoulder pain after the laparoscopic surgery: integers from 1 to 6.</p>
</dd>
<dt>pain</dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector indicating the shoulder pain rated by the patient on a scale coded into five ordered categories, where
1 indicated "low pain" and 5 reflected "high pain".</p>
</dd>
<dt>pain2</dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector indicating the shoulder pain rated by the patient and coded as 1 for the two first categories of
pain and 0 for other cases.</p>
</dd>
