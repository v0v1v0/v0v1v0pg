<h2>In vitro measurement of percentage cell death - two-way ANOVA design with repeated measures, and randomised blocks.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These are measurements of death of infected host cells (as percentage of total cells) upon infection with two strains of bacteria, measured at two time points, in 6 independent experiments.  These data repeated-measures data suitable for two-way linear mixed effects modelling with experiment and subjects as random factors.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data_2w_Tdeath
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>data.frame:	24 obs. of  6 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Experiment</dt>
<dd>
<p>A random factor with 6 levels "e1", "e2"...</p>
</dd>
<dt>Time</dt>
<dd>
<p>A fixed factor with 2 levels: "t100" &amp; "t300".</p>
</dd>
<dt>Time2</dt>
<dd>
<p>A numeric column that allows plotting data on a quantitative "Time" axis. The "Time" column has "factor" type values that should be used for the ANOVA..</p>
</dd>
<dt>Genotype</dt>
<dd>
<p>A fixed factor with 2 levels that we want to compare "WT" &amp; "KO".</p>
</dd>
<dt>Subject</dt>
<dd>
<p>A random factor with 12 levels: "s1", "s2"... These are cell culture wells that were measured at two time points, and indicate "subjects" that underwent repeated-measures within each of 6 experiments. Subject IDs for WT and KO are unique and clearly indicate different wells.</p>
</dd>
<dt>PI</dt>
<dd>
<p>Numerical dependent variable indicating propidium iodide dye uptake as a measure of cell death. These are percentage of dead cells out of total cells plated.</p>
</dd>
