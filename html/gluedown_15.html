<h2>Markdown fenced code block</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Turn a character vector of lines into a single code block with lines
bookended with a code fence of backticks or tildes. This markdown leaf block
can be rendered as HTML <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠&lt;code&gt;⁠</code> tags inside <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠&lt;pre&gt;⁠</code> tags.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">md_fence(x, char = c("`", "~"), info = "r")
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A character vector of lines to be wrapped concatenated into a single
block, possibly created by possibly created by <code>readLines()</code> or
<code>deparse()</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>char</code></td>
<td>
<p>The character to use in the code fence; either backtick
characters... or tildes (<code>~</code>). Defaults to backticks.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>info</code></td>
<td>
<p>The info string text to follow the initial code fence, typically
a code for the language of the lines of <code>x</code>. Defaults to <code>r</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A code fence is a sequence of at least three consecutive backtick characters
... or tildes (<code>~</code>). (Tildes and backticks cannot be mixed.) A fenced code
block begins with a code fence, indented no more than three spaces.
</p>
<p>The line with the opening code fence may optionally contain some text
following the code fence; this is trimmed of leading and trailing whitespace
and called the info string...
</p>
<p>The content of the code block consists of all subsequent lines, until a
closing code fence of the same type as the code block began with (backticks
or tildes), and with at least as many backticks or tildes as the opening code
fence...
</p>
<p>A fenced code block may interrupt a paragraph, and does not require a blank
line either before or after.
</p>
<p>The content of a code fence is treated as literal text, not parsed as
inlines. The first word of the info string is typically used to specify the
language of the code sample, and rendered in the class attribute of the code
tag. However, this spec does not mandate any particular treatment of the info
string (see the <code>info</code> argument).
</p>
