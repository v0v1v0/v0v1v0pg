<h2>Get the Timezone Information</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A function to retrieve the system timezone on Unix systems
 which has been found to find an answer when 'Sys.timezone()' has failed.
 It is based on an answer by Duane McCully posted on 'StackOverflow', and
 adapted to be callable from R. The package also builds on Windows, but
 just returns NULL.</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>R has a function <code>Sys.timezone</code> which tries hard to
retrieve the same information.  However, we have found instances
where it failed to provide an answerâ€”whereas the simple code in
this package does.
</p>
<p>This package provides a single function <code>gettz</code> which looks
at <code>/etc/timezone</code> (on Debian/Ubuntu), <code>/etc/sysconfig/clock</code>
(on RedHat/CentOS/Fedora) or <code>/etc/TIMEZONE</code> (on Solaris).  
In case no information can be provided, <code>NULL</code> is returned.
</p>
<p>Windows support is bare-bones: the package builds, but does not do
anything. One could probably deploy custom code to query the registry
but given that R already does, there is imminent need.
