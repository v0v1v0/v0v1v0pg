<h2>Measurement of 38 nutrients (NHANES dataset)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>We created the 'tiwqs_data' dataset to show how apply the two-indices WQS (2iWQS).
These data reflect 38 nutrients measured in 5960 subjects participating in the NHANES study
(2011-2012, 2013-2014, 2015-2016 cycles). Nutrients were estimated from the dietary intake
data that considered the types and amounts of foods and beverages consumed during the 24-hour
period prior to the interview. Two interviews were performed: the first one was collected
in-person while the second interview was collected by telephone 3 to 10 days later. In this
study we averaged the two nutrients when both evaluations were considered as usual food
consumption (only one measurement was included in the analysis if the other one was not usual
while the observation was dropped if both evaluations were not usual) and we added the dietary
supplement intake when applicable.
Additionally, BMI as both a continuous variable ('bmxbmi') and categorical variable ('bmi_cat')
was included as outcome variable.
A total of 10 covariates can also be found in the dataset
