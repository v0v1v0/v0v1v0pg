<h2>Obtain an updated graph by updating an initial graphical after deleting
hypotheses</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>After a hypothesis is deleted, an initial graph will be updated. The deleted
hypothesis will have the hypothesis weight of 0 and the transition weight of
0. Remaining hypotheses will have updated hypothesis weights and transition
weights according to Algorithm 1 of Bretz et al. (2009).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">graph_update(graph, delete)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>graph</code></td>
<td>
<p>An initial graph as returned by <code>graph_create()</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>delete</code></td>
<td>
<p>A logical or integer vector, denoting which hypotheses to
delete. A logical vector results in the "unordered mode", which means that
hypotheses corresponding to <code>TRUE</code> in <code>delete</code> will be deleted. The
sequence of deletion will follow the sequence of <code>TRUE</code>'s in <code>delete</code>. In
this case, the length of the logical vector must match the number of
hypotheses in <code>graph</code>. An integer vector results in the "ordered mode",
which means that <code>delete</code> specifies the sequence in which hypotheses
should be deleted by indicating the location of deleted hypotheses, e.g.,
1st, 2nd, etc. In this case, the integer vector can have any length, but
must only contain valid hypothesis numbers (greater than 0, and less than
or equal to he number of hypotheses in <code>graph</code>).</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An S3 object of class <code>updated_graph</code> with a list of 4 elements:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>initial_graph</code>: The initial graph object.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>updated_graph</code>: The updated graph object with specified hypotheses
deleted.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>deleted</code>: A numeric vector indicating which hypotheses were deleted.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>intermediate_graphs</code>: When using the ordered mode, a list of
intermediate updated graphs after each hypothesis is deleted according
to the sequence specified by <code>delete</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Sequence of deletion</h3>

<p>When there are multiple hypotheses to be deleted from a graph, there are many
sequences of deletion in which an initial graph is updated to an updated
graph. If the interest is in the updated graph after all hypotheses specified
by <code>delete</code> are deleted, this updated graph is the same no matter which
sequence of deletion is used. This property has been proved by Bretz et al.
(2009). If the interest is in the intermediate updated graph after each
hypothesis is deleted according to the sequence specified by <code>delete</code>, an
integer vector of <code>delete</code> should be specified and these detailed outputs
will be provided.
