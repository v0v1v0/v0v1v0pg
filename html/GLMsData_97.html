<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data gives the smoking and survival data for
1314 women in Whickham (north England).
A survey was originally conducted in 1972–1974;
a subsequent survey twenty years later followed up the women
to determine how many women from the original survey had died.
(Of the original women in the survey,
180 have been excluded here:
18 whose smoking habits were not recorded,
and 162 who were smokers before the first survey
but were non-smokers at the time of the second survey.)
