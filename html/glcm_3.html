<h2>GLCM textures calculated in EXELIS ENVI (for testing purposes)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is the output from running a "co-occurrence measures" calculation to 
calculate GLCM textures in EXELIS ENVI from the <code>test_raster</code> included 
in the <code>glcm</code> package. The following settings were used: window size 
3x3; co-occurrence shift 1 row (y in ENVI), 1 column (x in ENVI); greyscale 
textures to compute: mean, variance, homogeneity, contrast, dissimilarity, 
entropy, second moment, correlation.
