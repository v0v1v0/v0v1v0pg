<h2>Constrained Least Squares Forecast Combination</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Computes forecast combination weights using constrained least squares (CLS) regression.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">comb_CLS(x)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class 'foreccomb'. Contains training set (actual values + matrix of model forecasts) and optionally a test set.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The function is a wrapper around the constrained least squares (CLS) forecast combination implementation of the
<em>ForecastCombinations</em> package.
</p>
<p>Compared to the <code>ordinary least squares forecast combination</code> method, CLS forecast combination has the additional
requirement that the weights, <code class="reqn">\mathbf{w}^{CLS} = (w_1, \ldots, w_N)'</code>, sum up to 1 and that there is no intercept. That is,
the combinations of <code>comb_CLS</code> are affine combinations.
</p>
<p>This method was first introduced by Granger and Ramanathan (1984). The general appeal of the method is its ease of interpretation (the
weights can be interpreted as percentages) and often produces better forecasts than the OLS method when the individual forecasts are
highly correlated. A disadvantage is that if one or more individual forecasts are biased, this bias is not corrected through the
forecast combination due to the lack of an intercept.
</p>
<p>In addition to the version presented by Granger and Ramanathan (1984), this variant of the method adds the restriction that combination
weights must be non-negative, which has been found to be almost always outperform unconstrained OLS by Aksu and Gunter (1992) and
was combined with the condition of forcing the weights to sum up to one by Nowotarski et al. (2014), who conclude that even though the
method provides a suboptimal solution in-sample, it almost always produces better
forecasts than unrestricted OLS out-of-sample.
</p>
<p>The results are stored in an object of class 'foreccomb_res', for which separate plot and summary functions are provided.
</p>
