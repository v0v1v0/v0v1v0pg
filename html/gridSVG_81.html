<h2>
Create the definition of a non-rectangular clipping path.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A feature of SVG is that elements can be clipped to by more than just
a rectangular region. Most graphical elements can be drawn. The
purpose of these functions is to define a more sophisticated clipping
path that will be applied until the current viewport (or context, see
<code>popContext</code>) is popped.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">clipPath(grob)
registerClipPath(label, clippath)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>grob</code></td>
<td>

<p>A grid grob.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>label</code></td>
<td>

<p>A character identifier that will be used to reference this
definition.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>clippath</code></td>
<td>

<p>A <code>clipPath</code> object produced by <code>clipPath</code> that
defines a clipping path region.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A clipping path will be drawn within the current viewport at the time
of definition (if the grob has no <code>vp</code> specified).
</p>
<p>Most grobs can be used for clipping but there are some limitations on
what will actually be used for clipping. In general though, anything
that is drawn as the clipping path will have the union of its drawn
regions become the new region that the current viewport (or grob) will
clip to.
</p>
<p>The limitations are as follows:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> Any viewport pushed by the clipping path grob will no longer
clip to its contents. However, its clipping region will remain. This
means that the clipping region for a pushed viewport will become the
union of its contents and the viewport clipping region itself,
instead of just the pushed viewport's clipping region.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> When drawing a <code>textGrob</code>, only character labels will be
used, no <code>plotmath</code> expressions will be used.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> No <code>pointGrob</code>s are able to be used for clipping.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Any operations that apply to containers (e.g. gpars,
garnishing, animation), will no longer work. Any operations that are
not applied to groups are unaffected. This affects in particular
viewports, gTrees, and the familiar gridSVG grob grouping that
occurs.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
