<h2>glmglrt: GLRT P-Values in Generalized Linear Models</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package has been developed to provide Generalized Likelihood Ratio Tests (GLRT)
also known as Likelihood Ratio Tests (LRT) to Generalized Linear Models (GLMs).
The stats package do support LRT P-values with <code>anova</code> and
derived confidence intervals with <code>confint()</code>, but provides Wald's P-values with
the <code>summary</code> function.
This is unfortunate for two reasons: Wald's P-values may be inconsistent with profile-likelihood
confidence intervals and Wald's P-values, on small samples are more biased than LRT P-values, for
non-gaussian models. The <code>anova</code> function is not as simple as
<code>summary</code>, since it requires manually fitting two models.
</p>


<h3>Summary function</h3>

<p>This package provides a way to override (see override_summary) the standard <code>summary.glm</code> function
by a <code>summarylr</code> function that provides LRT and/or Rao's score P-values.
</p>


<h3>Functions to estimate contrasts</h3>

<p>It also provides functions <code>estimate_contrast</code>, <code>confint_contrast</code> and <code>p_value_contrast</code>
to estimate contrasts of coefficients of GLMs with LRT, Rao's and Wald's hypothesis tests and confidence intervals
This is an alternative to <code>multcomp::glht</code> without
Wald's approximation ! It also provides a less powerful <code>p_value.glm</code> method for the S3 generic
parameters::p_value. It also extends this S3 generic for a variety
of models as <code>p_value.default</code>. That time, the only method supported for all models, is Wald's method.
