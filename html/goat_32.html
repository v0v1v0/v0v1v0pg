<h2>Compute a score between -1 and 1 representing the proportion of up- or down-regulated genes for each geneset, weighted by gene effectsizes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Importantly, the scope/utility of this score is limited to help users post-hoc filter for genesets that contain mostly up/down-regulated genes.
However, this might not coincide with the geneset pvalues / significance. For example,
genesets may exclusively contain genes with a positive effectsize but at the same time these can all be minor effects/values and thus the geneset
is not significant or less significant than other genesets with the exact same "directionality score".
For example, genesets may contain both up- and down-regulated genes but still be significant when testing with GOAT and using <code>score_type='effectsize'</code>
</p>
<p>The scores computed with this function can help in post-hoc interpretation of GOAT results to further narrow down all significant genesets to a
subset with strong directionality. For example, after <code>test_genesets()</code> we can filter the results for
A) significant genesets and B) that contain at most N genes and C) that are near-exclusively up/down-regulated.
Bringing this all together (also useful for other types of geneset testing, like ORA, score_type="pvalue", etc);
<code>result = test_genesets(genesets_filtered, genelist, method = "goat", score_type = "effectsize", padj_method = "bonferroni", padj_cutoff = 0.05)</code>
<code>result = score_geneset_directionality(result, genelist)</code>
<code>result |&gt; filter(signif &amp; ngenes &lt;= 100 &amp; abs(score_directionality_rank) &gt;= 0.95)</code>
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">score_geneset_directionality(genesets, genelist)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>genesets</code></td>
<td>
<p>tibble with genesets, must contain columns 'source', 'id', 'genes'</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>genelist</code></td>
<td>
<p>tibble with genes, must contain columns 'gene', 'effectsize'</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>input <code>genesets</code> with results in 3 columns;
<code>score_directionality_rank</code> is the weighted gene score where gene values are the sign of their effectsize and weights are linearly proportional to their inverse ranks in the input genelist.
<code>score_directionality_rank2</code> is similar, but now using rank^2 gene weights to boost the influence of most-important genes in the input genelist.
<code>score_directionality_value</code> uses the absolute gene effectsizes as gene weights
Note that the latter is least robust as it depends on the scaling of input data!
</p>


<h3>score definitions;</h3>

<p>geneset directionality score = weighted mean of respective genes,
where gene weights are 1 minus their relative rank in up/down-regulation (depending on negative/positive effectsize)
and the value for each gene is -1 or 1 depending on up/down-regulation (sign of effectsize).
</p>
