<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Path-based geometry decomposition to data frame.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The goal of gibble is to provide a straightforward map of path-based data
structures. Paths are connected linear sequences of coordinates, otherwise
known as <em>lines</em>. Structured spatial data includes <em>objects</em> composed of
<em>paths</em>, which are islands, holes within island, lines, and points. Polygons
require an extra grouping level <em>subobject</em> to ensure holes are nested
within their island, but this is ignored for other types.
</p>
<p>Sequential inear structures are not optimal for many operations when
working with spatial data, and gibble provides a simple bridge between
existing paths and tools to decompose them to primitives.
