<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <em>Shapley and Shubik index</em> works as follows. There is a group of individuals all willing to vote on a proposal. They vote in order and as soon as a majority has voted for the proposal, it is declared passed and the member who voted last is given credit for having passed it. Let us consider that the members are voting randomly. Then we compute the frequency with which an individual is the one that gets the credit for passing the proposal. That measures the number of times that the action of that individual joining the coalition of their predecessors makes it a winning coalition. Note that if this index reaches the value of 0, then it means that this player is a dummy. When the index reaches the value of 1, the player is a dictator.
