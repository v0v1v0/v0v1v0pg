<h2>List of the selected genes along with their corresponding overlapped QTL</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function enables to obtain list of the selected genes along with the corresponding overlapped Quantitative Trait Loci (QTL) ids/names along with their genomic positions.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">geneqtl(geneset, genelist, qtl)</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>geneset</code></td>
<td>
<p>geneset is a vector of characters representing the names of genes/ gene ids selected from the whole gene list/space by using a gene selection method.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>genelist</code></td>
<td>
<p>genelist is a N by 3 dataframe/ matrix (genes/gene ids as row names); where, N represents the number of genes in the whole gene set: first coloumn represnting the chromosomal location of genes: second coloumn representing the start position of genes in terms of basepairs: third coloumn representing the end position of genes in terms of basepairs in their respective chromosomes.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>qtl</code></td>
<td>
<p>qtl is a Q by 3 dataframe/matrix (qtl names/qtl ids as row names);where, Q represents the number of qtls: first coloumn represnting the chromosomal location of qtls: second coloumn representing the start position of qtls in terms of basepairs: third coloumn representing the end position of qtls in terms of basepairs in their respective chromosomes.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The function returns a list with two components. First component returns the list of selected genes along with their overlapped QTL ids/names. Second component gives the list of selected genes with their overlapped QTL ids/names and their respective genomic positions.</p>
