Data and scripts for ‘Generalized Additive Models: An Introduction with R’
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package contains the data sets used in the book
<em>Generalized Additive Models: An Introduction with R</em>, which covers linear and generalized linear models, GAMs as implemented in package <code>mgcv</code> and
mixed model extensions of these.
</p>
<p>There are help files containing the R code for each chapter and its exercise solutions, for the second edition of the book.
</p>
<p>The script files for the first edition of the book can be found in the 'scripts' folder of the 'inst' folder of the source package. They have been modified slightly to work with recent versions of mgcv (e.g. &gt;= 1.7-0).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Each dataset has its own help page, which describes the dataset, and
gives the original source and associated references. All datasets have been
reformatted into standard R data frames. Some smaller datasets from the book
have not been included. Datasets from other R packages have not been
included, with the exception of a distillation of one set from the 
<code>NMMAPSdata</code> package.
