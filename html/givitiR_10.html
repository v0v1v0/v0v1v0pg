<h2>givitiR: assessing the calibration of binary outcome models with the GiViTI calibration belt.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The package 'givitiR' provides the functions to plot the
GiViTI calibration belt and to compute the associated statistical test.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The name of the approach derives from the GiViTI (Gruppo Italiano per la valutazione
degli interventi in Terapia Intensiva,
Italian Group for the Evaluation of the Interventions in Intensive Care Units), an
international network of intensive care units (ICU) established in Italy in 1992.
The group counts more than 400 ICUs from 7 countries, with about the half of the participating
centers continuosly collecting data on the admitted patients through the PROSAFE project (PROmoting patient SAFEty
and quality improvement in critical care). For further information, see the
package vignette and the references therein.
</p>
<p>The GiViTI calibration belt has been developed within the methodological research
promoted by the GiViTI network, with the purposes of a) enhancing the quality of the
logistic regression models built in the group's projects b) providing the participating ICUs
with a detailed feedback about their quality of care. A description of the approach
and examples of applications are reported in the package vignette.
</p>
<p>The main functions of the package are listed below.
