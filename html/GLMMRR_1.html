<h2>Online Survey on "Exams and Written Papers"</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The goal of the survey was to estimate the prevalence of various forms of student misconduct such as plagiarizing or cheating in exams.
Because students might be reluctant to reveal information on such behaviors, special techniques for sensitive questions were employed in addition to direct questioning.
Respondents were randomly assigned to direct questioning or one of five different sensitive question techniques.
The dataset contains the (randomized or direct) responses from 4281 students of the University of Bern and ETH Zurich.
Each row holds the response to one question for one respondent.
The variables are as follows:
