<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Observations of vascular plant cover in 126 one-square-meter plots divided over four transects. The ordinal responses are on a five-degree Hult-Sernander-Du Rietz scale, and were originally recorded by Wolfgang and Cramer (1987) and additionally analyzed by ter Braak (1987). There is a total of 64 unique sites, that were surveyed in two different years (1978 and 1984), but two plots were only surveyed in one year (thus bringing the total number of rows in the data to 126). The plots were located on an elevation gradient, running from the shoreline to the edge of old-growth forest. Elevation to the shoreline was recorded in centimeters during the sampling in 1978.
