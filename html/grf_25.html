<h2>Retrieve a single tree from a trained forest object.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Retrieve a single tree from a trained forest object.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">get_tree(forest, index)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>forest</code></td>
<td>
<p>The trained forest.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>index</code></td>
<td>
<p>The index of the tree to retrieve.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A GRF tree object containing the below attributes.
drawn_samples: a list of examples that were used in training the tree. This includes
examples that were used in choosing splits, as well as the examples that populate the leaf
nodes. Put another way, if honesty is enabled, this list includes both subsamples from the
split (J1 and J2 in the notation of the paper).
num_samples: the number of examples used in training the tree.
nodes: a list of objects representing the nodes in the tree, starting with the root node. Each
node will contain an 'is_leaf' attribute, which indicates whether it is an interior or leaf node.
Interior nodes contain the attributes 'left_child' and 'right_child', which give the indices of
their children in the list, as well as 'split_variable', and 'split_value', which describe the
split that was chosen. Leaf nodes only have the attribute 'samples', which is a list of the
training examples that the leaf contains. Note that if honesty is enabled, this list will only
contain examples from the second subsample that was used to 'repopulate' the tree (J2 in the
notation of the paper).
