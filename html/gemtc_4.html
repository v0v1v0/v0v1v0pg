<h2>Prevention of stroke in atrial fibrillation patients</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset of 25 trials investigating 17 treatments for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation patients. The main outcome is the number of patients with a stroke, and a covariate captures the proportion of patients with a prior stroke.
</p>
<p>Data are take from Table 1 of Cooper et al. (2009), with the following corrections applied: SPAF 3 and AFASAK 2 do not have a treatment 13 arm, and SPAF 1 does not contain treatment 5, but treatment 6. Thanks to prof. Cooper for providing the original analysis dataset.</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A network meta-regression dataset containing 60 rows of arm-based data (responders and sample size).</p>
