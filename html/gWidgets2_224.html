<h2>constructor for a two-paned container</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A container for holding two child widgets where the space
allocated to each can be manipulated by the user with a pane
between the widgets, or programatticaly via <code>svalue&lt;-</code>.  The
value specified to <code>svalue&lt;-</code> can be a number in $[0,1]$, in
which case it is a proportion or an integer, in which case it is a
pixel size (from the left or the top). The ambiguous case <code>1</code>
or <code>1L</code> is determined by class. The value of <code>svalue</code> is in proportion units.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">gpanedgroup(horizontal = TRUE, container = NULL, ..., toolkit = guiToolkit())

.gpanedgroup(toolkit, horizontal = TRUE, container = NULL, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>horizontal</code></td>
<td>
<p>direction of layout</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>container</code></td>
<td>
<p>A parent container. When a widget is created it can be
incorporated into the widget heirarchy by passing in a parent
container at construction time. (For some toolkits this is not
optional, e.g. <span class="pkg">gWidgets2tcltk</span> or <span class="pkg">gWidgets2WWW2</span>.)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>These values are passed to the <code>add</code> method of the
parent container. Examples of values are <code>expand</code>,
<code>fill</code>, and <code>anchor</code>, although they're not always
supported by a given widget. For more details see add.
Occasionally the variable arguments feature has been used to sneak
in hidden arguments to toolkit implementations. For example, when
using a widget as a menubar object one can specify a parent
argument to pass in parent information, similar to how the
argument is used with gaction and the dialogs.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>toolkit</code></td>
<td>
<p>Each widget constructor is passed in the toolkit it
will use. This is typically done using the default, which will
lookup the toolkit through <code>guiToolkit</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Child widgets are added in the usual way, typically through the
<code>container</code> argument of a constructor. Only two children may
be added. Children expand and fill the allocated space.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>Setting the size is often only possible after the container
has been realized on the screen. In the example, this call of
<code>svalue&lt;-</code> is done after the parent window is made visible
for this reason. There were arguments to specify the children at
construction, but these have been removed.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## Not run: 
w &lt;- gwindow("gpanedgroup", visible=FALSE)
pg &lt;- gpanedgroup(cont=w)
gbutton("left", cont=pg)
gbutton("right", cont=pg)

visible(w) &lt;- TRUE
svalue(pg) &lt;- 0.33

## End(Not run)
</code></pre>
