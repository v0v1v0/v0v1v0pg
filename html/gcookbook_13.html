<h2>Attempted sexual relations in Mad Men (TV show)</h2>

Mad Men, as of the end of season 4. Each row represents an attempted sexual
relation: the character in the first column, Name1, attempted to have sex
with the character in the second column, Name2. If the relationship goes in
both directions (the characters had sex with each other), then there will be

directed graph.
