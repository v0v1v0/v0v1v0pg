<h2>EM-AMMI imputation method</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function was writted by Paderewski (2013) and allow imputing
missing values by the EM-AMMI algorithm
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">EM.AMMI(
  X,
  PC.nb = 1,
  initial.values = NA,
  precision = 0.01,
  max.iter = 1000,
  change.factor = 1,
  simplified.model = FALSE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>X</code></td>
<td>
<p>a data frame or matrix with genotypes in rows and
environments in columns when there are no replications of the
experiment.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>PC.nb</code></td>
<td>
<p>the number of principal components in the AMMI model that will be
used; default value is 1. For PC.nb=0 only main effects are used to
estimate cells in the data table (the interaction is ignored). The number of
principal components must not be greater than min(number of rows in the X
table, number of columns in the X table)–2.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>initial.values</code></td>
<td>
<p>(optional) initial values of missing cells. It
can be a single value, which then will be used for all empty cells, or a
vector of length equal to the number of missing cells (starting from the
missing values in the first column). If omitted, initial values will be
obtained by the main effects from the corresponding model, that is, by
grand mean of observed data increased (or decreased) by row and column
main effects.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>precision</code></td>
<td>
<p>(optional) algorithm converges if the maximal change in
the values of the missing cells in two subsequent steps is not greater than
this value (the default is 0.01).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>max.iter</code></td>
<td>
<p>(optional) a maximum permissible number of iterations (that
is, number of repeats of the algorithm’s steps 2 through 5); default
value is 1000.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>change.factor</code></td>
<td>
<p>(optional) introduced by analogy to step size in gradient
descent method, this parameter that can shorten the time of executing the
algorithm by decreasing the number of iterations. The change.factor=1
(default) defines that the previous approximation is changed with the new
values of missing cells (standard EM-AMMI algorithm). However, when
change.factor&lt;1, then the new approximations are computed and the values of
missing cells are changed in the direction of this new approximation but the
change is smaller. It could be useful if the changes are cyclic and thus
convergence could not be reached. Usually, this argument should not affect
the final outcome (that is, the imputed values) as compared to the default
value of change.factor=1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>simplified.model</code></td>
<td>
<p>the AMMI model contains the general mean, effects of
rows, columns and interaction terms. So the EM-AMMI algorithm in step 2
calculates the current effects of rows and columns; these effects change
from iteration to iteration because the empty (at the outset) cells in each
iteration are filled with different values. In step 3 EM-AMMI uses those
effects to re-estimate cells marked as missed (as default,
simplified.model=FALSE). It is, however, possible that this procedure will
not converge. Thus the user is offered a simplified EM-AMMI procedure that
calculates the general mean and effects of rows and columns only in the
first iteration and in next iterations uses these values
(simplified.model=TRUE). In this simplified procedure the initial values
affect the outcome (whilst EM-AMMI results usually do not depend on initial
values). For the simplified procedure the number of iterations to
convergence is usually smaller and, furthermore, convergence will be reached
even in some cases where the regular procedure fails. If the regular
procedure does not converge for the standard initial values (see the
description of the argument initial.values), the simplified model can be
used to determine a better set of initial values.</p>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list containing:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>  X: the imputed matrix (filled in with the missing values estimated
by the EM-AMMI procedure);
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> PC.SS: the sum of squares representing variation explained
by the principal components (the squares of eigenvalues of singular value
decomposition);
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> iteration: the final number of iterations;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> precision.final: the maximum change of the estimated values for
missing cells in the last step of iteration (the precision of convergence)
. If the algorithm converged, this value is slightly smaller than the
argument precision;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> PC.nb.final: a number of principal components that were eventually
used by the EM.AMMI() function. The function checks if there are too many
missing cells to unambiguously compute the parameters by the SVD
decomposition (Gauch and Zobel, 1990). In that case the final number of
principal components used is smaller than that which was passed on to the
function through the argument PC.nb;
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> convergence: the value TRUE means that the algorithm converged in
the last iteration.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
