<h2>Test maps included with <code>grainscape</code>
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Intended for users to explore the functionality of the package using simple
and artificial land cover maps.
These maps have four or five discrete land cover classes (integers from 1 to 5)
intended to represent distinct land cover types.
Typical analyses begin by reclassifying these to reflect resistance to movement.

<dl>
<dt><code>patchy.asc</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A caricatured map of four land cover classes, where
patches are large and easy to identify polygonal regions for heuristic purposes.
This unrealistic map can be used to illustrate the method and understand how it works.
The map also serves a similar heuristic purpose in a review of graph-based
connectivity methods (Galpern <em>et al.</em>, 2011). (400 x 400 raster cells.)</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>fragmented.asc</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>A simulated land cover map with five land cover
classes using an algorithm that produces fragmentation. (400 x 400 raster cells.)</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>tiny.asc</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Similar to <code>fragmented.asc</code> but smaller in extent
for lightning-fast computation and experimental use. (100 x 100 raster cells.)</p>
