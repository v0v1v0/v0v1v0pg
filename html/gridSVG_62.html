<h2>
Mapping Viewport, Grob and Reference Names to SVG IDs
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function is both a getter and a setter function for mapping
information imported from a plot unknown to the current R session.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">gridSVGMappings(newmappings = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>newmappings</code></td>
<td>

<p>A named list mapping information, produced by
<code>grid.export</code>.
</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In order to generate unique names for SVG IDs, gridSVG output will not
produce the same names as are visible on the grid display list. This
function will store and return mapping information. This is
information on how names have been translated from their original
grob/viewport names to their SVG IDs.
</p>
<p>Mapping information is stored as a list with 4 components, viewport
mapping information, grob mapping information, reference mapping
information and the ID separator used at the time of exporting.
</p>
<p>Viewport, grob, and reference mapping information is stored as the
name of the object, paired with a vector of suffixes associated with
these names. When combined with the ID separator, we can construct the
SVG IDs that have been applied, given each name. Use
<code>getSVGMappings</code> to do this.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>If <code>newmappings</code> is <code>NULL</code>, then we get back a named list
representing name mapping information.
</p>
<p>If we pass the named list representing mapping information into the
function, we get no output.
