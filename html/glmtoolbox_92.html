<h2>Dental Clinical Trial</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These data arose from a study in dentistry. In this trial,
subjects were generally healthy adult male and female volunteers, ages
18–55, with pre-existing plaque but without advanced periodontal
disease. Prior to entry, subjects were screened for a minimum of 20
sound, natural teeth and a minimum mean plaque index of 2.0. Subjects
with gross oral pathology or on antibiotic, antibacterial, or
anti-inflammatory therapy were excluded from the study. One hundred
nine volunteers were randomized in a double-blinded way to one of two
novel mouth rinses (A and B) or to a control mouth rinse. Plaque was
scored at baseline, at 3 months, and at 6 months by the Turesky
modification of the Quigley-Hein index, a continuous measure. Four
subjects had missing plaque scores. The main objective of the
analysis is to measure the effectiveness of three mouth rinses at
inhibiting dental plaque.
