<h2>Gene Set Analysis with Quantitative Trait Loci with gene sampling model</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function computes the statistical significance value (p-value) from gene set analysis test with QTL for the test H0: Genes in the selected geneset are at most as often overlapped with the QTL regions as the genes in not selected geneset; against H1: Genes in the geneset are more often overlapped with the QTL regions as compared to genes in not selected geneset.</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">GSAQ(geneset, genelist, qtl, SampleSize, K, method)</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>geneset</code></td>
<td>
<p>geneset is a vector of characters representing the names of genes/ gene ids selected from the whole gene list by using a gene selection method.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>genelist</code></td>
<td>
<p>genelist is a N by 3 dataframe/ matrix (genes/gene ids as row names); where, N represents the number of genes in the whole gene space: first coloumn represnting the chromosomal location of genes: second coloumn representing the start position of genes in terms of basepairs: third coloumn representing the end position of genes in terms of basepairs in their respective chromosomes.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>qtl</code></td>
<td>
<p>qtl is a Q by 3 dataframe/matrix (qtl names/qtl ids as row names);where, Q represents the number of qtls: first coloumn represnting the chromosomal location of qtls: second coloumn representing the start position of qtls in terms of basepairs: third coloumn representing the end position of qtls in terms of basepairs in their respective chromosomes.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>SampleSize</code></td>
<td>
<p>SampleSize is a numeric constant representing the size of the gene sample drawn from the geneset using the gene sampling model (SampleSize must be less than the size of geneset).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>K</code></td>
<td>
<p>K is a numeric constant representing the number of gene samples of size equal to SampleSize will be drawn by the using gene sampling model.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>method is a character string indicating which method for final p-value (combining p-values for various gene samples) is to be computed. One of "meanp", "sump", "logit", "sumz"or "logp" (default) can be abbreviated and used.</p>
