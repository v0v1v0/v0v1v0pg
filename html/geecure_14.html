<h2>Multi-Center Clinical Trial of Tonsil Carcinoma</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A tonsil cancer clinical trial study conducted by the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group in the United States. The survival time is defined as the time (in days) from diagnosis to death. In this study, patients in one institution were randomly assigned to one of two treatment groups: radiation therapy alone or radiation therapy together with a chemotherapeutic agent. A part of the data from the study is available in Kalbfleisch and Prentice (2002).</p>

<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A part of the data from the study is available in Kalbfleisch and Prentice (2002), which includes times (in days) from diagnosis to death of 195 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of three sites in the oropharynx between 1968 and 1972 in six participating institutions. Other variables include
