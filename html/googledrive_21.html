<h2>Copy a Drive file</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Copies an existing Drive file into a new file id.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">drive_cp(
  file,
  path = NULL,
  name = NULL,
  ...,
  overwrite = NA,
  verbose = deprecated()
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>file</code></td>
<td>
<p>Something that identifies the file of interest on your Google
Drive. Can be a name or path, a file id or URL marked with <code>as_id()</code>, or a
<code>dribble</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>path</code></td>
<td>
<p>Specifies target destination for the new file on Google
Drive. Can be an actual path (character), a file id marked with
<code>as_id()</code>, or a <code>dribble</code>.
</p>
<p>If <code>path</code> is a shortcut to a folder, it is automatically resolved to its
target folder.
</p>
<p>If <code>path</code> is given as a path (as opposed to a <code>dribble</code> or an id), it is
best to explicitly indicate if it's a folder by including a trailing
slash, since it cannot always be worked out from the context of the call.
By default, the new file has the same parent folder as the
source file.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>name</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character, new file name if not specified as part of
<code>path</code>. This will force <code>path</code> to be interpreted as a folder, even if it
is character and lacks a trailing slash. Defaults to "Copy of <code>FILE-NAME</code>".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>
<td>
<p>Named parameters to pass along to the Drive API. Has dynamic dots semantics. You can affect the metadata of the target file by
specifying properties of the Files resource via <code>...</code>. Read the "Request
body" section of the Drive API docs for the associated endpoint to learn
about relevant parameters.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>overwrite</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical, indicating whether to check for a pre-existing file
at the targetted "filepath". The quotes around "filepath" refer to the fact
that Drive does not impose a 1-to-1 relationship between filepaths and files,
like a typical file system; read more about that in <code>drive_get()</code>.
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>NA</code> (default): Just do the operation, even if it results in multiple
files with the same filepath.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>TRUE</code>: Check for a pre-existing file at the filepath. If there is
zero or one, move a pre-existing file to the trash, then carry on. Note
that the new file does not inherit any properties from the old one, such
as sharing or publishing settings. It will have a new file ID. An error is
thrown if two or more pre-existing files are found.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>FALSE</code>: Error if there is any pre-existing file at the filepath.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that existence checks, based on filepath, are expensive operations, i.e.
they require additional API calls.</p>

<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>verbose</code></td>
<td>
<p><a href="https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#deprecated"><img src="../help/figures/lifecycle-deprecated.svg" alt="[Deprecated]"></a> This logical argument to
individual googledrive functions is deprecated. To globally suppress
googledrive messaging, use <code>options(googledrive_quiet = TRUE)</code> (the default
behaviour is to emit informational messages). To suppress messaging in a
more limited way, use the helpers <code>local_drive_quiet()</code> or
<code>with_drive_quiet()</code>.</p>

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
# Target one of the official example files
(src_file &lt;- drive_example_remote("chicken.txt"))

# Make a "Copy of" copy in your My Drive
cp1 &lt;- drive_cp(src_file)

# Make an explicitly named copy, in a different folder, and star it.
# The starring is an example of providing metadata via `...`.
# `starred` is not an actual argument to `drive_cp()`,
# it just gets passed through to the API.
folder &lt;- drive_mkdir("drive-cp-folder")
cp2 &lt;- drive_cp(
  src_file,
  path = folder,
  name = "chicken-cp.txt",
  starred = TRUE
)
drive_reveal(cp2, "starred")

# `overwrite = FALSE` errors if file already exists at target filepath
# THIS WILL ERROR!
# drive_cp(src_file, name = "Copy of chicken.txt", overwrite = FALSE)

# `overwrite = TRUE` moves an existing file to trash, then proceeds
cp3 &lt;- drive_cp(src_file, name = "Copy of chicken.txt", overwrite = TRUE)

# Delete all of our copies and the new folder!
drive_rm(cp1, cp2, cp3, folder)

# Target an official example file that's a csv file
(csv_file &lt;- drive_example_remote("chicken.csv"))

# copy AND AT THE SAME TIME convert it to a Google Sheet
chicken_sheet &lt;- drive_cp(
  csv_file,
  name = "chicken-sheet-copy",
  mime_type = drive_mime_type("spreadsheet")
)
# is it really a Google Sheet?
drive_reveal(chicken_sheet, "mime_type")$mime_type

# go see the new Sheet in the browser
# drive_browse(chicken_sheet)

# Clean up
drive_rm(chicken_sheet)
