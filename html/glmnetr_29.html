<h2>Plot nested cross validation performance summaries</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function plots summary information from a nested.glmnetr() output object, that 
is from a nested cross validation performance.  Alternamvely one can output the 
numbers otherwise displayed to a list for extraction or customized plotting.  Performance
measures for plotting include "devrat" the deviance ratio, i.e. the fractional 
reduction in deviance relative to the null model deviance, "agree" a measure 
of agreement, "lincal" the slope from a linear calibration and "intcal" the 
intercept from a linear calibration.  Performance measure estimates 
from the individual (outer) cross validation fold are depicted by thin lines 
of different colors and styles, while the composite value from all folds is 
depicted by a thicker black line, and the performance measures naively 
calculated on the all data using the model derived from all data is 
depicted by a thicker red line.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">plot_perf_glmnetr(
  x,
  type = "devrat",
  pow = 2,
  ylim = 1,
  fold = 1,
  xgbsimple = 0,
  plot = 1
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A nested.glmnetr output object</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>determines what type of nested cross validation performance measures are 
plotted.  Possible values are 
"devrat" to plot the deviance ratio, i.e. the fractional reduction in 
deviance relative to the null model deviance, 
"agree" to plot agreement in terms of concordance, correlation or R-square, 
"lincal" to plot the linear calibration slope coefficients, 
"intcal" to plot the linear calibration intercept coefficients, 
from the (nested) cross validation.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pow</code></td>
<td>
<p>Power to which agreement is to be raised when the "gaussian" model 
is fit, i.e. 2 for R-square, 1 for correlation.  Does not apply to type = "lasso".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ylim</code></td>
<td>
<p>y axis limits for model perforamnce plots, i.e. does not apply to 
type = "lasso".  The ridge model may calibrate very poorly obscuring plots for 
type of "lincal" or "intcal", so one may specify the ylim value.  If ylim is 
set to 1, then the program will derive a reasonable range for ylim.  If ylim is 
set to 0, then the entire range for all models will be displayed.  Does not 
apply to type = "lasso".</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>fold</code></td>
<td>
<p>By default 1 to display using a spaghetti the performance as 
calculated from the individual folds, 0 to display using dots only the composite 
values calculated using all folds.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>xgbsimple</code></td>
<td>
<p>1 (default) to include results for the untuned XGB model, 0 to not include.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>plot</code></td>
<td>
<p>By default 1 to produce a plot, 0 to return the data used in the 
plot in the form of a list.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>This program returns a plot to the graphics window by default, and returns
a list with data used in teh plots if the plot=1 is specified.
