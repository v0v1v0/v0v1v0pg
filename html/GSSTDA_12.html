<h2>Disease-Specific Genomic Analysis</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Disease-Specific Genomic Analysis (dsga).
This analysis, developed by Nicolau <em>et al.</em>, allows the calculation of
the "disease component" of a expression matrix which consists of, through
linear models, eliminating the part of the data  that is considered normal
or healthy and keeping only the component that is due to the disease. It
is intended to precede other techniques like classification or clustering.
For more information see <em>Disease-specific genomic analysis: identifying
the signature of pathologic biology</em> (doi: 10.1093/bioinformatics/btm033).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">dsga(
  full_data,
  survival_time,
  survival_event,
  case_tag,
  control_tag = NA,
  gamma = NA,
  na.rm = TRUE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>full_data</code></td>
<td>
<p>Input matrix whose columns correspond to the patients and
rows to the genes.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>survival_time</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numerical vector of the same length as the number of
columns of <code>full_data</code>. In addition, the patients must be in the same
order as in <code>full_data</code>. For the patients whose sample is pathological
should be indicated the time between the disease diagnosis and event
(death, relapse or other). If the event has not occurred, it should be
indicated the time until the end of follow-up. Patients whose sample is
from healthy tissue must have an NA value</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>survival_event</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numerical vector of the same length as the number of
columns of <code>full_data</code>. Patients must be in the same order as in
<code>full_data</code>. For the the patients with pathological sample should
be indicated whether the event has occurred (1) or not (0). Only these
values are valid and healthy patients must have an NA value.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>case_tag</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character vector of the same length as the number of
columns of <code>full_data</code>. Patients must be in the same order as in
<code>full_data</code>. It must be indicated for each patient whether its
sample is from pathological or healthy tissue. One value should be used to
indicate whether the patient's sample is healthy and another value should
be used to indicate whether the patient's sample is pathological.
The user will then be asked which one indicates whether the patient is
healthy. Only two values are valid in the vector in total.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>control_tag</code></td>
<td>
<p>Tag of the healthy sample.E.g. "T"</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>gamma</code></td>
<td>
<p>A parameter that indicates the magnitude of the noise assumed in
the flat data matrix for the generation of the Healthy State Model. If it
takes the value <code>NA</code> the magnitude of the noise is assumed to be unknown.
By default gamma is unknown.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>na.rm</code></td>
<td>
<p><code>logical</code>. If <code>TRUE</code>, <code>NA</code> rows are omitted.
If <code>FALSE</code>, an error occurs in case of <code>NA</code> rows. TRUE default
option.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <code>dsga</code> object. It contains: the <code>full_data</code> without
NAN's values, the label designated for healthy samples (<code>control_tag</code>),
the <code>case_tag</code> vector without NAN's values, the <code>survival_event</code>,
the the <code>survival_time</code> the matrix with the normal space (linear space
generated from normal tissue samples) and the matrix of the disease
components (the transformed full_data matrix from which the normal component
has been removed).
</p>
