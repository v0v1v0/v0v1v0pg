<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A soft drink bottler is analyzing vending machine service routes in his distribution system.
He is interested in predicting the amount of time required by the route driver 
to service the vending machines in an outlet. 
The service activity includes
the time taken to stock the machine with beverage products,
and for minor maintenance and housekeeping. 
</p>
<p>The industrial engineer responsible for the study 
has suggested that the two most important variables affecting the delivery time
are the number of cases of product stocked and the distance walked by the route driver.
