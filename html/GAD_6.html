<h2>Distribution patterns of the crab <em>Ucides cordatus</em> at different spatial scales</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Distribution patterns of the mangrove crab <em>Ucides cordatus</em> were assessed
at four levels of spatial hierarchy (from meters to tens of km) using a nested
ANOVA and variance components measures. The design included four spatial scales
of variation: regions (10s km), locations (km), sites (10s m), and quadrats (m).
Three regions tens of kilometers apart were sampled across the Paranagua Bay
salinity-energy gradient. Within each region, three locations
(1.5 - 3.5 km apart from each other) were randomly chosen. In each location,
three sites of 10 x 10 m were randomized, and within these, five quadrats
of 2 x 2 m were sampled (Sandrini-Neto and Lana, 2012).
