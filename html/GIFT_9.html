<h2>Select non-overlapping regions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Identify overlapping regions in a set of GIFT regions and choose only
non-overlapping regions based on size and overlap criteria
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">GIFT_no_overlap(
  entity_IDs = NULL,
  area_threshold_island = 0,
  area_threshold_mainland = 100,
  overlap_threshold = 0.1,
  geoentities_overlap = NULL,
  api = "https://gift.uni-goettingen.de/api/extended/",
  GIFT_version = "latest"
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>entity_IDs</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of IDs of the regions for which we want to check
overlap</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>area_threshold_island</code></td>
<td>
<p>A number stating from which surface the
smallest overlapping polygon is kept. By default set to 0 square kilometer
(meaning that by default the smallest islands will be conserved).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>area_threshold_mainland</code></td>
<td>
<p>When two polygons overlap, the smallest or
the biggest one can be kept. When the surface of the smallest polygon
exceeds this number, the smallest polygon is kept. Otherwise, we keep the
bigger one. Set by default 100 square-kilometers.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>overlap_threshold</code></td>
<td>
<p>A number ranging from 0 to 1, indicating at what
percentage of overlap, partially overlapping polygons should be kept.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>geoentities_overlap</code></td>
<td>
<p>A table coming from GIFT indicating the
overlap in km^2 between pairs of polygons.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>api</code></td>
<td>
<p>character string defining from which API the data will be
retrieved.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>GIFT_version</code></td>
<td>
<p>character string defining the version of the GIFT
database to use. The function retrieves by default the <code>latest</code> stable
version. If set to <code>beta</code>, the most up-to-date version which is still
subject to changes and edits is used.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A vector of entity_IDs (identification numbers of polygons)
non-overlapping.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
ex &lt;- GIFT_no_overlap(entity_IDs = c(10071, 12078)) # Andalusia and Spain. 
# We get Andalusia because it is smaller than Spain and larger than 100 km²
ex2 &lt;- GIFT_no_overlap(entity_IDs = c(10071, 12078), 
area_threshold_mainland = 100000) # since Andalusia is smaller than
# 100,000 km² large, the larger entity (Spain) is chosen here.
