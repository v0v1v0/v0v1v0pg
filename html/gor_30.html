<h2>Graphs and Network Optimization algorithms</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a hardly complete collection of algorithms
from the subject "Graphs and Network Optimization".
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Functions in this package have been written for teaching
purposes.  Therefore, no attempt at production versions of the
algorithms has been made.  They are neither complete nor
completely correct, although a great effort has been invested
in their construction and debugging.  All of them pass a
series of tests given in the examples sections of the
corresponding help pages.  Comments and suggestions are
welcome, even if I cannot guarantee that they will be
incorporated to the package.
</p>
<p>This package makes extensive use of the igraph package
functions, which should be loaded before using "gor".
</p>
<p>Some functions in this package perform tasks which can be found in
other well-tested packages such as igraph or TSP.  As said
before, these functions have been written with teaching in
mind, and I do not claim that gor functions are better than
any other in any way whatsoever.
