<h2>Fit density-weighted proportion (DWP) models.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Carcass density is modeled as a function of distance from
turbine. Format and usage parallel that of common <code>R</code> functions
<code>lm</code>, <code>glm</code>, and <code>gam</code> and the GenEst functions <code>pkm</code>
and <code>cpm</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">dwpm(data_DWP, type = "data", unitCol = NULL, dwpCols = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data_DWP</code></td>
<td>
<p>data frame with structure depending on model
type. In general, <code>data_DWP</code> would be a data frame if a model is to be
fit or if point estimates only are provided as pre-simulated DWP data, and,
if pre-simulated data with variation are provided, then a 2-d array (if one
carcass class) or a list of 2-d arrays (if more than one carcass class). See
"Details" for details.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The fraction of carcasses falling in the area searched at a turbine
may be a function of carcass class (e.g., large or small) and/or direction
from the turbine. Data may be provided for fitting a distance model(s) or,
alternatively, simulated turbine-wise DWP data from custom-fitted models may
be provided. If pre-fit, pre-simulated data are used, then <code>glm</code> returns
a <code>dwpm</code> object with <code>type = data</code>.
</p>
<p>To fit a model, <code>data_DWP</code> should be a data frame with a row for each carcass
and columns giving (at a minimum) unique carcass IDs, turbine ID, distance
from turbine, and fraction of area searched at the given distance at the
given turbine. Optional columns may include carcass class, covariates that may
influence detection probability (e.g., visibility class), and direction.
If covariates are to be included in the model, then the fraction of area
column would give the fraction of the area in the given covariate level at
that distance. Alternatively, prefab data may be provided in a dataframe,
with structure depending on data type. The simplest case would be that
point estimates only are provided. In that case, if there are no distinctions
among carcass classes (e.g., size), then <code>data_DWP</code> should be a dataframe
with one column giving the unit (e.g., turbine) and one column with the DWP
at each unit; if distinctions are made among carcass classes, then <code>data_DWP</code> would
be a data frame with a unit column and a DWP column for each carcass class. If
the DWP estimates incorporate uncertainties, then <code>data_DWP</code> should be
an array with <code>n_unit * nsim</code> rows and with colunms for units and DWPs for
each carcass class.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>an object of an object of class <code>dwpm</code>, which is a list with
model <code>type</code> (currently only <code>type = data</code> is supported) and
<code>model</code>, which gives the simulated DWP values as an array (if there's
only a single carcass class) or a list of arrays (if there are more than one
carcass classes).
