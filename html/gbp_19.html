<h3>Description</h3>

<p>solve gbp2d w.r.t select most preferable often smallest bin from bn list
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">gbp2d_solver_dpp_filt(ld, m)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ld</code></td>
<td>
<p>it scale &lt;matrix&gt;
- l, d it scale along x and y &lt;numeric&gt;</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>m</code></td>
<td>
<p>bn scale &lt;matrix&gt;
- l, d bn scale along x and y &lt;numeric&gt;
- l, d in row and each col is a single bn
</p>
<p>should make sure bn list are sorted via volume
so that the first col is the most prefered smallest bn, and also
the last col is the least prefered largest and often dominant bn
</p>
<p>should make sure no X in front of Y if bnX dominant bnY,
bnX dominant bnY if all(X(l, d) &gt; Y(l, d)) and should always prefer Y.
</p>
<p>should make sure bn such that l &gt;= d or vice versa.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>gbp2d_solver_dpp_filt is built on top of gbp2d_solver_dpp
aims to select the most preferable bn from a list of bn that can fit all or most it
</p>
<p>gbp2d_solver_dpp()'s objective is fit all or most it into a single given bn (l, d)
</p>
<p>gbp2d_solver_dpp_filt()'s objective is select the most preferable given a list of bn
where bn list is specified in 2xN matrix that the earlier column the more preferable
</p>
<p>gbp2d_solver_dpp_filt() use an approx binary search and determine f w.r.t bn.n_cols
where f = 1 indicate the bn being selected and only one of 1 in result returned.
</p>
<p>ok = true if any bin can fit all it and algorithm will select smallest bn can fit all
otherwise ok = false and algorithm will select a bn can maximize volume of fitted it
</p>
<p>often recommend to make the last and least preferable bn dominate all other bn in list
when design bn list, bnX dominant bnY if all(X(l, d) &gt; Y(l, d)).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>gbp2q
a gbp2q instantiate with p profit, it item (x, y, l, d) position scale matrix, bn bin (l, d) scale matrix,
k it selection, o objective, f bn selection, and ok an indicator of all fit or not.
