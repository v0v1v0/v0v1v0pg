<h2>Compute the portfolio return knowing the rank of a stock in the 
input ‘mtx’.
This function computes the return earned knowing the rank of a stock 
computed elsewhere and named myrank associate with the data columns in
the input mtx of stock returns. For example, mtx has p=28 Dow Jones stocks
over n=169 monthly returns. Portfolio weights are assumed to be linearly
declining. If maxChosen=4, the weights are 1/10, 2/10, 3/10 and 4/10, which add
up to unity. These portfolio weights are assigned in their order
in the sense that first chosen stock (choice rank =p) gets portfolio weight=4/10.
The function computes return from the stocks using the ‘myrank’ argument.
This helps in assessing out-of-sample performance of (short) 
the strategy of selling lowest ranking stocks. It is mostly for internal use
by <code>outOFsell()</code>. This is a sell version of <code>rank2return()</code>.</h2>

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">rank2sell(mtx, myrank, maxChosen = 0, pctChoose = 20, verbo = FALSE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mtx</code></td>
<td>
<p>a matrix with n rows (number of returns) p columns (number of stocks)</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>myrank</code></td>
<td>
<p>vector of p integers listing the rank of each stock, 1=best</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>maxChosen</code></td>
<td>
<p>number of stocks in the portfolio (with nonzero weights)
default=0. When maxChosen=0, we let pctChoose determine the maxChosen</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pctChoose</code></td>
<td>
<p>percent of p stocks chosen inside the portfolio, default=20</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>verbo</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical if TRUE, print, default=TRUE</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>average return from the linearly declining
portfolio implied by the myrank vector.
