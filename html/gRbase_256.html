<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data come from a study of the effects of five dietary regimens with
different fatty acid compositions on liver lipids and hepatic gene
expression in wild-type and PPAR-alpha-deficient mice (Martin et al., 2007).
</p>
<p>There were 5 replicates per genotype and diet combination.
</p>
<p>There are two design variables: (i) genotype, a factor with two levels:
wild-type (wt) and PPAR-alpha-deficient (ppar), and (ii) diet, a factor with
five levels. The oils used for experimental diet preparation were: corn and
colza oils (50/50) for a reference diet (ref); hydrogenated coconut oil for
a saturated fatty acid diet (coc); sunflower oil for an Omega6 fatty
acid-rich diet (sun); linseed oil for an Omega3-rich diet (lin); and
corn/colza/enriched (43/43/14) fish oils (fish).
</p>
<p>There are 141 response variables: (i) the log-expression levels of 120 genes
measured in liver cells, and (ii) the concentrations (in percentages) of 21
hepatic fatty acids measured by gas chromatography.
