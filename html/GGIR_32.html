Function to read activity log and make it useful for the rest of GGIR.
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Function to read activity log and convert it into data.frame
that has for each ID and date a different qwindow vector.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">  g.conv.actlog(qwindow, qwindow_dateformat="%d-%m-%Y", epochSize = 5)	
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>qwindow</code></td>
<td>

<p>Path to csv file with activity log. Expected format of the activity diary is:
First column headers followed by one row per recording, first column is recording ID,
which needs to match with the ID GGIR extracts from the accelerometer file.
Followed by date column in format "23-04-2017", where date format is specified by 
argument qwindow_dateformat (below). Use the character combination date, Date or 
DATE in the column name. This is followed by 
one or multiple columns with start times for the activity types in that day format in 
hours:minutes:seconds. The header of the column will be used as label for each activity
type. Insert a new date column before continuing with activity types for next day.
Leave missing values empty. If an activitylog is used then individuals who do 
not appear in the activitylog will still be processed with value c(0,24).
Dates with no activiy log data can be skipped, no need to have a column with the 
date followed by a column with the next date. If times in the activitylog are not multiple 
of the short window size (epoch length), the next epoch is considered (e.g., with epoch of 5 seconds, 
8:00:02 will be redefined as 8:00:05 in the activity log).
