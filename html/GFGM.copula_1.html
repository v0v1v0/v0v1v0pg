<h2>
Generalized Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern Copula
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Compute bivariate dependence measures and perform bivariate competing risks analysis under the generalized Farlie-Gumbel-Morgenstern (FGM) copula. See Shih and Emura (2016, 2018) for details.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The functions in this package are based on latent failure time models with competing risks in Shih and Emura (2018). However, they can be adapted to dependent censoring models in Emura and Chen (2018). See <code>MLE.GFGM.spline</code> for example.
