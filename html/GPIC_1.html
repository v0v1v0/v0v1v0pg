<h3>Guidelines</h3>

<p>GPIC index reflects both the quantity and quality of
prizes that a group of participants obtained in individual competitions.
Call <code>vec2idx</code> and <code>df2idx</code> to compute GPIC index
for a single group and multiple groups, respectively. The results of
Vietnamese National Olympiads are provided as sample datasets
<code>vno</code> and <code>vnomath</code>.
