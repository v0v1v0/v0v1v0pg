<h2>Dataset ganglion</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>From Cleveland (1993): For species with highly developed visual systems, such as cats and man, the distribution of ganglion cells across the surface of the retina is not uniform. For example, cats at birth have a much greater density of cells in the central portion of the retina than on the periphery. But in the early stages of fetal development, the distribution of ganglion cells is uniform. The nonuniformity develops in later stages. The data presents the measurement for 14 cat fetuses ranging in age from 35 to 62 days of gestation of the ratio of the central ganglion cell density to the peripheral density and their retinal area, which is nearly monotonically increasing with age.
