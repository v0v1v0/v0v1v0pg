<h2>Urinary Tract Infections in HIV-infected Men</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These data arose from a study conducted in the Department
of Internal Medicine at Utrecht University Hospital, in the
Netherlands. In this study, 98 HIV-infected men were followed for
up to two years. Urinary cultures were obtained during the first
visit and every six months thereafter. Also, cultures were obtained
between regular scheduled visits when signs and symptoms of urinary
tract infections (UTI) occurred, or when patients had a fever of
unknown origin. CD4+ cell counts were also measured. A CD4+ count
is a blood test to determine how well the immune system works in
people diagnosed with HIV. In general, a decreasing CD4+ count
indicates HIV progression.

<pre><code class="language-R">data(uti)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 98 rows and 3 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>episodes</dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector indicating the number of episodes, that is, the number of times each patient had urinary tract infections (UTI).</p>
</dd>
<dt>time</dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector indicating the time to follow up, in months.</p>
</dd>
<dt>cd4</dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector indicating the immune status of the patient as measured by the CD4+ cell counts.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
