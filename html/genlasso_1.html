<h2>
Package to compute the solution path of generalized lasso problems
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package is centered around computing the solution path of the
generalized lasso problem, which minimizes the criterion
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">
    1/2 \|y - X \beta\|_2^2 + \lambda \|D \beta\|_1.
  </code>
</p>

<p>The solution path is computed by solving the equivalent Lagrange
dual problem. The dimension of the dual variable u is the number of
rows of the penalty matrix D, and the primal (original) and dual
solutions are related by
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">
    \hat{\beta} = y - D^T \hat{u}
  </code>
</p>

<p>when the predictor matrix X is the identity, and
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">
    \hat{\beta} = (X^T X)^{-1} (X^T y - D^T \hat{u})
  </code>
</p>

<p>for a full column rank predictor matrix X. For column rank deficient
matrices X, the solution path is not unique and not computed by this
package. However, one can add a small ridge penalty to the above
criterion, which can be re-expressed as a generalized lasso problem
with full column rank predictor matrix X and hence yields a unique
solution path.
</p>
<p>Important use cases include the fused lasso, where D is the oriented
incidence matrix of some underlying graph (the orientations being
arbitrary), and trend filtering, where D is the discrete difference
operator of any given order k.
</p>
<p>The general function <code>genlasso</code> computes a solution path
for any penalty matrix D and full column rank predictor matrix X
(adding a ridge penalty when X is rank deficient). For the fused lasso
and trend filtering problems, the specialty functions
<code>fusedlasso</code> and <code>trendfilter</code> should be used 
as they deliver a significant increase in speed and numerical
stability.
</p>
<p>For a walk-through of using the package for statistical modelling see
the included package vignette; for the appropriate background material
see the generalized lasso paper referenced below.
