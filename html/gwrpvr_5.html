<h2>gwrpvr: A package for calculating Genome-Wide Regression P-Values (gwrpv) in R</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Computes the sample probability value (p-value) for the estimated coefficient
from a standard genome-wide univariate regression.
It computes the exact finite-sample p-value under the assumption that
the measured phenotype (the dependent variable in the regression)
has a known Bernoulli-normal mixture distribution.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The gwrpvr package provides two functions:
gwrpv and gwrpv_batch.
