<h2>Alternative Implementations of Base R Functions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Alternative implementations of some base R functions, including sort, order, and match.  Functions are
simplified but can be faster or have other advantages.  See the documentation of individual functions
for details and benchmarks.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Note that these functions cannot be considered drop-in replacements for the functions in base <code>R</code>.  
They do not implement all the same parameters and do not work for all data types.  Utilize these 
with caution in specialized applications that require them.
