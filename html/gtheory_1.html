<h2>Apply generalizability theory with R.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>gtheory</code> provides functions for estimating variance components, generalizability coefficients, universe scores, and standard errors when observed scores contain variation from one or more measurement facets (e.g., items and raters).
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>gtheory</code> was designed to apply univariate and multivariate generalizability (G).  Use it to conduct G and decision (D) studies with balanced or unbalanced data.  Future releases will provide the means for calculating universe scores under univariate G theory or within strata, as well as universe-score profiles (a.k.a. augmented true scores) and composite scores under multivariate G theory.  Functions to find an optimal study design and to calculate conditional error variance are also in the works.
