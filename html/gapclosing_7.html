<h2>Gap closing estimator</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A function to estimate gap-closing estimands: means and disparities across categories of units that would persist under some counterfactual assignment of a treatment. To use this function, the user provides a data frame <code>data</code>, a rule <code>counterfactual_assignments</code> for counterfactually assigning treatment, a treatment and/or an outcome model for learning statistically about the counterfactuals, and the <code>category_name</code> of the variable in <code>data</code> over which categories are defined. The returned object summarizes factual and counterfactual means and disparities. Supported estimation algorithms include generalized linear models, ridge regression, generalized additive models, and random forests. Standard errors are supported by bootstrapping.

<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>Data frame containing the observed data</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>counterfactual_assignments</code></td>
<td>
<p>Numeric scalar or vector of length nrow(data), each element of which is on the [0,1] interval. If a scalar, the counterfactual probability by which all units are assigned to treatment condition 1. If a vector, each element i corresponds to the counterfactual probability by which each unit i is assigned to treatment condition 1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>outcome_formula</code></td>
<td>
<p>Outcome formula , in the style <code>outcome ~ treatment*covariate</code>. Covariates should include those needed for causal identification of the treatment effect (e.g. as defended in your Directed Acyclic Graph). If <code>outcome_algorithm</code> = "ranger", then the outcome model will be fit separately on the treatment and control groups. Otherwise, the user must specify all interactions in the formula.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>treatment_formula</code></td>
<td>
<p>Treatment formula, in the style <code>treatment ~ covariate</code>. Covariates should include those needed for causal identification of the treatment effect (e.g. as defended in your Directed Acyclic Graph).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>category_name</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character name of the variable indicating the categories over which the gap is defined. Must be the name of a column in <code>data</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>outcome_name</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character name of the outcome variable. Only required when there is no outcome_formula; otherwise extracted automatically. Must be a name of a column in <code>data</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>treatment_name</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character name of the treatment variable. Only required when there is no treatment_formula; otherwise extracted automatically. Must be a name of a column in <code>data</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>treatment_algorithm</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character name of the algorithm for the treatment model. One of "glm", "ridge", "gam", or "ranger". Defaults to "glm", which is a logit model. Option "ridge" is ridge regression. Option "gam" is a generalized additive model fit (see package <code>mgcv</code>). Option "ranger" is a random forest (see package <code>ranger</code>). If "ranger", this function avoids propensity scores equal to 0 or 1 by bottom- and top-coding predicted values at .001 and .999.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>outcome_algorithm</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character name of the algorithm for the outcome model. One of "lm", "ridge", "gam", or "ranger". Defaults to "lm", which is an OLS model. Option "ridge" is ridge regression. Option "gam" is a generalized additive model fit (see package <code>mgcv</code>). Option "ranger" is a random forest (see package <code>ranger</code>).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sample_split</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character for the type of sample splitting to be conducted. One of "single_sample" or "cross_fit". Defaults to "single_sample", in which case <code>data</code> is used for both learning the nuisance functions and aggregating to an estimate. Option "cross_fit" uses cross-fitting to repeatedly use part of the sample to learn the nuisance function and another part to estimate the estimand, averaged over repetitions with these roles swapped.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>se</code></td>
<td>
<p>Logical indicating whether standard errors should be calculated. Default is FALSE. Standard errors assume a simple random sample by default; to stratify by (category x treatment), see the <code>bootstrap_method</code> argument. Because many datasets are not simple random samples, users should carefully consider whether a simple random sample bootstrap will accurately capture uncertainty.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>bootstrap_samples</code></td>
<td>
<p>Only used if <code>se = TRUE</code>. Number of bootstrap samples. Default is 1000.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>bootstrap_method</code></td>
<td>
<p>Only used if <code>se = TRUE</code>. A character string stating how to conduct bootstrap samples. If "simple", then samples are drawn with replacement from the full data. If "stratified", then the bootstrap is carried out within subpopulations defined by category and treatment. The latter may be useful if the sample contains only a small number of observations in these cells and the user wants to ensure that every (category x treatment) cell appears in every bootstrap sample. With "stratified", inference assumes that in repeated samples from the true population the proportion in each (category x treatment) cell would not change; this may or may not correspond to the true sampling process. Users should be cautious.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>parallel_cores</code></td>
<td>
<p>Integer number of cores for parallel processing of the bootstrap. Defaults to sequential processing.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>weight_name</code></td>
<td>
<p>Character name of a sampling weight variable, if any, which captures the inverse probability of inclusion in the sample. The default assumes a simple random sample (all weights equal).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n_folds</code></td>
<td>
<p>Only used if <code>method</code> = "cross_fit" and if <code>folds</code> is not provided. Integer scalar containing number of cross-validation folds. The function will assign observations to folds systematically: sort the data by the variable named <code>category_name</code>, then by the treatment variable, then at random. On this sorted dataset, folds are assigned systematically by repeated <code>1:n_folds</code>. To be used if the user does not provide <code>folds</code>. Defaults to 2.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>folds_name</code></td>
<td>
<p>Only used if <code>method</code> = "cross_fit". Character string indicating a column of <code>data</code> containing fold identifiers. This may be preferable to <code>n_folds</code> if the researcher has a reason to assign the folds in these data by some other process, perhaps due to particulars of how these data were generated. If null (the default), folds are assigned as stated in <code>n_folds</code>.</p>
