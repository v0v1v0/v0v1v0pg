</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>FOREST_TREND</strong>. Classification metric of 0 (no loss) or a discrete value from 1 to 17, representing loss (a stand-replacement disturbance or change from a forest to non-forest state) detected primarily in the year 2001-2019, respectively.
</p>
</li>

</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>TEMP_SIGNIF</strong>. Continuous metric of temperature trend significance, the temperature trends divided by its standard error.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>CLIM_EXTREME</strong>. Continuous metric calculated as whatever is the largest of the absolute of the trend coefficients of the months with the lowest or highest mean temperatures.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><strong>CLIM_VELOCITY</strong>. Continuous metric of the velocity of climate change, the ratio between TEMP_TRENDS and a local spatial gradient in mean temperature calculated as the slope of a plane fitted to the values of a 3x3 cell neighbourhood centered on each pixel.
</p>
</li>
