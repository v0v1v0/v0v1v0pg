<h2>Supported object types</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The different filters provided by ggfx are applicable to a wide range of
object types. Rather than documenting how to use them with each type in every
documentation entry, the information is collected here. While the examples
will use <code>with_blur()</code> they are general and applicable to all filters in
ggfx.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>All filters will generally return a new version of the same object,
the only exception being filtering of rasters, functions, and references
which returns a Layer object
</p>


<h3>Method specific arguments</h3>


<ul>
<li> <p><code>id</code>: A string that identifies the result of this filter, to be referenced
by other filters in the same graphic.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>include</code>: A logical flag that indicates whether the filtered image should
be displayed. By default, the result will not be displayed if it is given
an <code>id</code> (as it is assumed that it is meant for later use), but this can be
overewritten by setting <code>include = TRUE</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ignore_background</code>: Should the background of the plot be removed before
applying the filter and re-added afterwards?
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>background</code>: A grob to draw below the result of the filter. Mainly for
internal use for supporting <code>ignore_background</code>.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Filtering layers</h3>

<p>This is perhaps the most common and obvious use of ggfx, and the one
show-cased in the respective docs of each filter. In order to apply a filter
to a ggplot2 layer you wrap it around the layer constructor (usually a
<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠geom_*()⁠</code> function) and pass in additional parameters after it:
</p>
<div class="sourceCode r"><pre>ggplot(mtcars) +
  with_blur(
    geom_point(aes(x = mpg, y = disp)),
    sigma = 4
  )
</pre></div>
<p>Apart from the arguments specific to the filter, layer filters also take an
<code>id</code>, and <code>include</code> argument. Providing an id (as a string) will make this
filter be referable by other filters. By default this turns of rendering of
the result, but setting <code>include = TRUE</code> will turn rendering back on (while
still making it referable). Referable layers should <strong>always</strong> come before
whatever other layer ends up referring to them, since ggfx does not have
control over the rendering order. Not following this rule will have undefined
consequences (either an error or a weird plot - or maybe the correct result)
</p>


<h3>Filtering layer references</h3>

<p>While the first argument to a filter is mostly some sort of graphic
generating object, it can also be a text string referring to another filter.
This allows you to string together filters, should you so choose. The big
caveat is that filtering a reference will always result in a layer - i.e. it
is not compatible outside of ggplot2.
</p>
<div class="sourceCode r"><pre>ggplot(mtcars) +
  with_blur(
    geom_point(aes(x = mpg, y = disp)),
    sigma = 4,
    id = 'blurred_points'
  ) +
  with_shadow(
    'blurred_points'
  )
</pre></div>


<h3>Filtering guides</h3>

<p>ggplot2 does not only consist of layers - there are all sort of other graphic
elements around them. Guides are one such type of element and these can be
filtered by wrapping the filter around the guide constructor:
</p>
<div class="sourceCode r"><pre>ggplot(mtcars) +
  geom_point(aes(x = mpg, y = disp, colour = gear)) +
  guides(colour = with_blur(guide_colourbar(), sigma = 4))
</pre></div>
<p>There is a caveat here in that it is not possible to use this with the string
shorthand (i.e. <code>with_blur('colourbar')</code> won't work) — you have to use the
functional form.
</p>


<h3>Filtering theme elements</h3>

<p>Theme elements, like guides, is another non-layer graphic that is amenable to
filtering. It can be done by wrapping the <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠element_*()⁠</code> constructor with a
filter:
</p>
<div class="sourceCode r"><pre>ggplot(mtcars) +
  geom_point(aes(x = mpg, y = disp)) +
  ggtitle("A blurry title") +
  theme(plot.title = with_blur(element_text(), sigma = 4))
</pre></div>
<p>There is a caveat here as well. The filtering doesn't get carried through
inheritance so you cannot set filtering at a top-level element and expect all
child elements to be filtered.
</p>


<h3>Filtering ggplots</h3>

<p>While you normally only want to add a filter to a part of the plot, it is
also possible to add it to everthing, simply by wrapping the filter function
around the plot. You can elect to remove the background element while
applying the filter and add it back on afterwards by setting
<code>ignore_background = TRUE</code> on the filter
</p>
<div class="sourceCode r"><pre>p &lt;- ggplot(mtcars) +
  geom_point(aes(x = mpg, y = disp))

with_blur(p, sigma = 4)
</pre></div>
<p>An alternative is to put the filter around the <code>ggplot()</code> call, which will
have the same effect and may fit better with your plot construction code
</p>
<div class="sourceCode r"><pre>with_blur(ggplot(mtcars), sigma = 4) +
  geom_point(aes(x = mpg, y = disp))
</pre></div>


<h3>Filtering grobs</h3>

<p>At the lowest level, it is possible to apply a filter to a grob. This is what
powers all of the above at some level and that power is also available to
you. It is done in the same manner as all of the above, by wrapping the grob
in a filter:
</p>
<div class="sourceCode r"><pre>blurred_circle &lt;- with_blur(circleGrob(), sigma = 4)

grid.newpage()
grid.draw(blurred_circle)
</pre></div>
<p>As with layers, filters applied to grobs also take an <code>id</code> and <code>include</code>
argument and they have the same effect. It should be noted that it can be
difficult to grasp the rendering order of elements in a manually created grid
graphics, so take care when using filters that refer to each other as the
rule about the rendering order still applies.
</p>
<p>There are not a lot of people who use grid directly, but if you develop
ggplot2 extensions the ability to apply filters to grobs means that you can
create geoms with filters build right into them!
