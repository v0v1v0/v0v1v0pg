<h3>Details</h3>


<p><em>Post-hoc</em> pooling is a procedure to remove terms from a model. It might be done by several reasons:
(i) lack of evidence against the null hypothesis of that term; (ii) a negative estimate of that term's component of variation (Fletcher and Underwood, 2002);
(iii) the hypothesis of interest can not be tested until some terms are excluded from the model (Anderson et al., 2008).
According to literature the term's p-value should exceed 0.25 before removing it (Underwood, 1997).<br></p>
<p>There are two different methods to remove a term from the model, determinated by <code>method</code> argument. When <code>method = "eliminate"</code>
the chosen term is completely excluded from the model and its sum of squares and degrees of freedom are pooled with the residual sum of squares and
degrees of freedom, as if the selected term had never been part of the model. When <code>method = "pool"</code> the chosen term's sum of squares and
degrees of freedom are pooled with its denominator's sum of squares and degrees of freedom. The removal of terms using <code>method = "pool"</code> will be
appropriated for most of situations (Anderson et al., 2008).<br></p>
<p>Note that removing a term has consequences for the construction of F-ratios (or quasi F-ratios), p-values and the estimation of components for the
remaining terms, so should be done wisely. When there is more than one term which might be removed from the model (which p-value exceed 0.25), it is
recommended to begin with the one having the smallest mean square (Anderson et. al, 2008).<br></p>
<p>Function <code>pooling</code> removes one term at once. After the removal of the term of interest, one should re-assess whether or not more terms should be
removed. If it is the case, the output of <code>pooling</code> function should be stored in a new object and the function should be run again, using this new
object in the <code>data</code> argument. This can be done successively. The way of <code>pooling</code> function does the analysis, step-by-step and storing the result
in a new object at each step, gives the user total control of what happens and makes it easier return to the previous results.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list of length 4, containing the table of pooled terms (<code>$pool.table</code>), the mean squares estimates (<code>$mse</code>),
the F-ratio versus (<code>$f.versus</code>) and the result of the analysis of variance (<code>$anova</code>).
