<h2>Summarize Growth Curves</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function finds the parameters that describe the input data's growth.
It does so by fitting the logistic curve to your growth curve measurements.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">SummarizeGrowth(data_t, data_n, t_trim = 0, bg_correct = "min", blank = NA)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data_t</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of timepoints (data_n must also
be provided and be the same length).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data_n</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of cell counts or absorbance readings.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>t_trim</code></td>
<td>
<p>Measurements taken after this time should not be included
in fitting the curve. If stationary phase is variable,
this may give you a better fit. A value of 0 means no
trimming. Defaults to no trimming (0).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>bg_correct</code></td>
<td>
<p>The background correction method to use. No background
correction is performed for the default "none". Specifying
"min" subtracts the smallest value in a column from all the
rows in that column, and specifying "blank" subtracts
the values from the blank vector from the data_n vector.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>blank</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of absorbance readings from a blank well
(typically contains only media) used for background
correction. The corresponding blank value is subtracted
from the data_n vector for each timepoint. Defaults to NA.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The logistic curve equation is
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">N_t = \frac{N_0 K} {N_0 + (K-N_0)e^{-rt}}</code>
</p>

<p>where <code class="reqn">N_t</code> is the number
of cells (or the absorbance reading) at time t, <code class="reqn">N_0</code> is the initial
cell count (or absorbance reading), K is the carrying capacity, and r is the
growth rate.
</p>
<p>The fitness proxies returned are the parameters of the logistic equation
and the area under the curve (a measure that integrates the effects
of <code class="reqn">N_0</code>, K, and r). See <code>gcfit</code> for more documentation on these.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of type gcfit containing the "fitness" proxies,
as well as the input data and the fitted model.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># We can check that the parameters that are found are the same
# as we use to generate fake experimental data. To do so, let's first
# generate the "experimental" data using the logistic equation,
# e.g., absorbance readings from a single well in a plate reader over time.

k_in &lt;- 0.5   # the initial carrying capacity
n0_in &lt;- 1e-5 # the initial absorbance reading
r_in &lt;- 1.2   # the initial growth rate
N &lt;- 50       # the number of "measurements" collected during the growth
              # curve experiment

data_t &lt;- 0:N * 24 / N   # the times the measurements were made (in hours)
data_n &lt;- NAtT(k = k_in, n0 = n0_in, r = r_in, t = data_t) # the measurements

# Now summarize the "experimental" growth data that we just generated
gc &lt;- SummarizeGrowth(data_t, data_n)

# Get the possible metrics for fitness proxies
gc$vals$r           # growth rate is a common choice for fitness
gc$vals$t_gen       # doubling time, or generation time, is also common
gc$vals$k
gc$vals$n0
gc$vals$auc_l
gc$vals$auc_e
gc$vals$t_mid

# Compare the data with the fit visually by plotting it
plot(gc)
