<h2>Function reporting detailed kernel causality results in a 7-column matrix 
(uses deprecated criterion 1, no longer recommended but may be useful for
second and third criterion typ=2,3)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The seven columns produced by this function summarize the results where the signs of
stochastic dominance order values (+1 or -1) are weighted by <code>wt=c(1.2,1.1, 1.05, 1)</code> to
compute an overall result for all orders of stochastic dominance by a weighted sum for
the criteria Cr1 and Cr2. The weighting is obviously not needed for the third criterion Cr3.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">some0Pairs(
  mtx,
  dig = 6,
  verbo = TRUE,
  rnam = FALSE,
  wt = c(1.2, 1.1, 1.05, 1),
  sumwt = 4
)
</code></pre>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The reason for slightly declining weights on the signs from
SD1 to SD4 is simply that the local mean comparisons 
implicit in SD1 are known to be
more reliable than local variance implicit in SD2, local skewness implicit in
SD3 and local kurtosis implicit in SD4. The source of slightly declining sampling
unreliability of higher moments is the
higher power of the deviations from the mean needed in their computations.
The summary results for all
three criteria are reported in one matrix called <code>outVote</code>: 
</p>
<p>typ=1 reports ('Y', 'X', 'Cause',
'SD1apd', 'SD2apd', 'SD3apd', 'SD4apd') naming variables identifying 'cause'
and measures of stochastic dominance using absolute values of kernel
regression gradients (or amorphous partial derivatives, apd-s) being minimized by
the kernel regression algorithm while
comparing the kernel regression of X on Y with that of Y on X.
</p>
<p>typ=2 reports ('Y', 'X', 'Cause', 'SD1res', 'SD2res', 'SD3res', 'SD4res')
and measures of stochastic dominance using absolute values of kernel
regression residuals comparing regression of X on Y with that of Y on X.
</p>
<p>typ=3 reports ('Y', 'X', 'Cause', 'r*x|y', 'r*y|x', 'r', 'p-val')
containing generalized correlation coefficients r*, 'r' refers to.
Pearson correlation coefficient p-val is the p-value for 
testing the significance of 'r'
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Prints three matrices detailing results for Cr1, Cr2 and Cr3.
It also returns a grand summary matrix called ‘outVote’ which summarizes all three criteria.
In general, a positive sign for weighted sum reported in the column ‘sum’ means
that the first variable listed as the input to this function is the ‘kernel cause.’  
For example, crime ‘kernel causes’ police officer deployment (not vice versa) is indicated by 
the positive sign of ‘sum’ (=3.175) reported for that example included in this package.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The output matrix last column for ‘mtcars’ example
has the sum of the scores by the three criteria
combined. If ‘sum’ is positive, then variable X (mpg) is more likely to have been
engineered to kernel cause the response variable Y, rather than vice versa.
</p>
<p>The European Crime data has all three criteria correctly suggesting that
high crime rate kernel causes the deployment of a large number of police officers.
