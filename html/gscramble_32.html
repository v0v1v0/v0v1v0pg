<h2>A simple example of a reppop table</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A <code>reppop</code> table in 'gscramble' is used to define how the founder populations
in a GSP (typically named something like "A", "B", etc.) are mapped to the
groups/populations of individuals, as specified in the individual meta data
(an example of which is found in <code>I_meta</code>).
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A tibble with three columns: <code>index</code>, which must be of type integer,
<code>pop</code>, and <code>group</code> of type character.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This particular version shows a situation where individuals from group Pop1 will be
sampled as founders from A and from group Pop2 will be sampled as founders from
B into the GSP.  Since this <code>RepPop1</code> example has two values of index: 1 and 2,
it specifies that individuals from the populations will be sampled without replacment,
two times into the founders on the pedigree.
