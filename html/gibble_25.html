<h2>hsh, home sweet home</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A testing data set, a list of poly, line, points. The relationships
between the objects cover many interesting cases. There are multi-island
objects with holes and other objects that fall inside those holes. All paths
share vertices with a neighbour. There is topological intersection
along a diagonal line where two objects meet and are joined by
shared vertices that were inserted deliberately.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>hsh_sf</code> is the holey home in sf format.
