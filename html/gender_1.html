<h2>Gender: predict gender by name from historical data</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Gender: predict gender from names using historical data
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Encodes gender based on names and dates of birth, using U.S. Census or Social
Security data sets. Requires separate download of datasets, which should be
done automatically and can be done manually by running
<code>install_genderdata_package()</code>.
</p>
<p>This package attempts to infer gender (or more precisely, sex assigned at
birth) based on first names using historical data, typically data that was
gathered by the state. This method has many limitations, and before you use
this package be sure to take into account the following guidelines.
</p>
<p>(1) Your analysis and the way you report it should take into account the
limitations of this method, which include its reliance of data created by the
state and its inability to see beyond the state-imposed gender binary. At a
minimum, be sure to read our article explaining the limitations of this
method, as well as the review article that is critical of this sort of
methodology, both cited below.
</p>
<p>(2) Do not use this package to study individuals: it is at most useful for
studying populations in the aggregate.
</p>
<p>(3) Resort to this method only when the alternative is not a more nuanced and
justifiable approach to studying gender, but where the alternative is not
studying gender at all. For instance, for many historical sources this
approach might be the only way to get a sense of the sex ratios in a
population. But ask whether you really need to use this method, whether you
are using it responsibly, or whether you could use a better approach instead.
