<h2>Calculate Overlap and Similarity Coefficients between Feature Lists</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function calculates the Overlap, Jaccard, and Soerensen-Dice coefficients to quantify
the similarity between feature lists. In addition to feature importance and permutation importance,
you can provide a custom list of feature names to be included in the overlap calculation.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">calculate_overlap_coefficients(pipeline_results, custom_lists = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>pipeline_results</code></td>
<td>
<p>A PipelineResults object containing the fitted pipelines, cross-validation results, selected features,
mean performance, and mean feature importances.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>custom_lists</code></td>
<td>
<p>An optional named list of character vectors. Each character vector should contain feature names.
The names of the list will be used as names in the resulting overlap coefficient matrices.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list containing lists of matrices, where each list corresponds to a different type of feature list (inbuilt feature importance, permutation importance, and custom lists if provided).
Within each of these lists, there are three matrices showing the Overlap, Jaccard, and Soerensen-Dice coefficients for the feature lists:
- @field overlap: A matrix showing the Overlap coefficients.
- @field jaccard: A matrix showing the Jaccard coefficients.
- @field soerensen: A matrix showing the Soerensen-Dice coefficients.
These matrices compare the feature lists against each other, providing a numerical measure of their similarity.
Note: If permutation importance data is not present in the <code>pipeline_results</code>, the corresponding list entry will be absent.

<pre><code class="language-R"># Basic Usage with Mock Data
# Create a mock PipelineResults object with minimal data
mock_pipeline_results &lt;- new("PipelineResults",
                             inbuilt_feature_importance = list(
                             "FeatureSet1" = data.frame(feature = c("feature1", "feature2")),
                             "FeatureSet2" = data.frame(feature = c("feature2", "feature3"))),
                             permutation_importance = list(
                             "FeatureSet1" = data.frame(feature = c("feature3", "feature4")),
                             "FeatureSet2" = data.frame(feature = c("feature1", "feature4"))))

# Calculate overlap coefficients without custom lists
overlap_results &lt;- calculate_overlap_coefficients(mock_pipeline_results)


# Including Custom Lists
# Create custom feature lists
custom_feature_lists &lt;- list("CustomList1" = c("feature5", "feature6"),
                             "CustomList2" = c("feature6", "feature7"))

# Calculate overlap coefficients with custom lists
overlap_results_custom &lt;- calculate_overlap_coefficients(mock_pipeline_results,
                                                         custom_feature_lists)
