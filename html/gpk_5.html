<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Cosmetic products can cause allergenic response in users. Such a development can do significant harm to the name of its producer. Hence it is routine to carry out safety tests. In a study to compare irritability of 4 products, seven individuals were asked to apply each product on forearm.  Higher the irritation score worse is the product.
