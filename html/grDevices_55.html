<h2>Query Capabilities of the Current Graphics Device</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Query the capabilities of the current graphics device.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">dev.capabilities(what = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr>
<td><code id="what">what</code></td>
<td>
<p>a character vector partially matching the names of the
components listed in section ‘Value’, or <code>NULL</code> which
lists all available capabilities.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The capabilities have to be specified by the author of the graphics
device, unless they can be deduced from missing hooks.  Thus they will
often by returned as <code>NA</code>, and may reflect the maximal
capabilities of the underlying device where several output formats are
supported by one device.
</p>
<p>Most recent devices support semi-transparent colours provided the
graphics format does (which PostScript does not).  On the other hand,
relatively few graphics formats support (fully or semi-) transparent
backgrounds: generally the latter is found only in PDF and PNG plots.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A named list with some or all of the following components, any of which may
take value <code>NA</code>:
</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><code>semiTransparency</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical:  Does the device support
semi-transparent colours?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>transparentBackground</code></td>
<td>
<p>character:  Does the device support
(semi)-transparent backgrounds?  Possible values are <code>"no"</code>,
<code>"fully"</code> (only full transparency) and <code>"semi"</code>
(semi-transparent background colours are supported).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>rasterImage</code></td>
<td>
<p>character: To what extent does the device support
raster images as used by <code>rasterImage</code> and
<code>grid.raster</code>?  Possible values <code>"no"</code>, <code>"yes"</code> and
<code>"non-missing"</code> (support only for arrays without any missing
values).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>capture</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical:  Does the current device
support raster capture as used by <code>grid.cap</code>?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>locator</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical:  Does the current device
support <code>locator</code> and <code>identify</code>?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>events</code></td>
<td>
<p>character:  Which events can be generated on this device?
Currently this will be a subset of <code>c("MouseDown",
      "MouseMove", "MouseUp", "Keybd")</code>, but other events may be
supported in the future.  </p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>patterns</code></td>
<td>
<p>character:  Does the device support pattern fills?
One or more of
<code>c("LinearGradient", "RadialGradient", "TilingPattern")</code>
May also be <code>FALSE</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>clippingPaths</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical:  Does the device support clipping
paths?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>masks</code></td>
<td>
<p>character:  Does the device support masks?
One or more of 
<code>c("alpha", "luminance")</code>
May also be <code>FALSE</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>compositing</code></td>
<td>
<p>character: Does the device support compositing
operators?
There are many possible operators and devices may support any
subset.  For example the <code>pdf</code> device supports
a set of “blend modes” whereas Cairo-based devices
support Porter-Duff operators as well.
May also be <code>FALSE</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>transformations</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical:  Does the devices support affine
transformations ?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>paths</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical:  Does the device support stroking and filling
paths?</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><code>glyphs</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical:  Does the device support rendering glyphs? </p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
