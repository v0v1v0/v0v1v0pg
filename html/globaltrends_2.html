<h2>Add sets of locations</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function adds a new set of locations for downloads and computations to
the database. The location set serves as input for all download and
computation functions.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">add_locations(locations, type, export = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>locations</code></td>
<td>
<p>Locations that should be added as set of locations. Vector of
type <code>character</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>type</code></td>
<td>
<p>Name of the location set that should be added. Object of type
<code>character</code> of length 1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>export</code></td>
<td>
<p>Indicator whether the new location set should be directly
exported to the package environment <code>gt.env</code>. Object of type <code>logical</code>,
defaults to <code>TRUE</code>.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Location sets control the locations for which data is downloaded or to which
computations are applied. By adding new location sets, the default sets
<em>countries</em> and <em>us_states</em> can be expanded by additional sets.
Thereby, users can compute DOI within a region (e.g., adding EU countries as
a set) or single countries (e.g., adding regions of France as a set). Download
and computation functions check whether data for a location already exists.
Therefore, data will not be duplicated when location data already exists from
another set.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Message that the location set has been created successfully. Location data is
written to table <em>data_locations</em>.
</p>


<h3>Warning</h3>

<p>Unfortunately, the Google Trends API cannot handle the location
"NA - Namibia". Therefore, the location will be dropped automatically.
