<h2>Collection of functions for plotting relations, generating tables, and more.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This is a collection of functions that I've found useful in my research.
The package is inspired by Frank Harrell's <span class="pkg">Hmisc</span> package. The main focus
is on tables, plots, and <span class="pkg">knitr</span>-integration.
</p>


<h3>Awesome tables</h3>

<p>The <code>getDescriptionStatsBy</code> is a straight forward function that
aims at helping you to generate descriptive table stratified by different
variables. In other words, the function returns everything you need for generating
a <em>Table 1</em> ready for publication. This function is accompanied by the
<code>describeMean</code>, <code>describeMedian</code>, <code>describeProp</code>,
and <code>describeFactors</code> functions.
</p>
<p>The <code>mergeDesc</code> allows you to merge a set of outputs <code>getDescriptionStatsBy</code>
into a <code>htmlTable</code> with the rgroup arguments automatically
generated, see <code>vignette("descriptives", package = "Gmisc")</code> for a
detailed workflow description.
</p>


<h3>Some fancy plots</h3>

<p>The transition plot function, <code>transitionPlot</code>, is for
descriptive purposes. It tries to illustrate the size of change
between one state and the next, i.e. a transition. This is
basically a graph of based upon <code>table(var1, var2)</code>.
</p>
<p>The <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_value_decomposition">Singular value decomposition</a>
is a common method for reducing the number of variables. Unfortunately
this compression can reduce the interpretability of the model. The <code>getSvdMostInfluential</code>
function tries to remedy that by identifying the most influential
elements from the <code>V</code>-matrix.
</p>


<h3>Other stuff</h3>

<p>The <code>insertRowAndKeepAttr</code> simply adds a row while remembering
all the attributes previously set by using the <code>copyAllNewAttributes</code>.
The <code>mergeLists</code> tries to merge lists that do not have identical
elements.
