<h2>R implementation of Thermodynamic Equation Of Seawater - 2010 (TEOS-10)</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Provides an R interface to the TEOS-10 / GSW (Gibbs Sea Water) library,
partly for use by the <code>oce</code> package (see <a href="https://dankelley.github.io/oce/">https://dankelley.github.io/oce/</a>)
and partly for general use. It is assumed that users are familiar with
the science and methodology of GSW, and that the package vignette
(obtained by typing <code>vignette("gsw")</code> in an R window) provides
enough orientation to get users started with the <code>gsw</code> functions.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p><code>gsw</code> was developed using open-source methodologies, on
the GitHub site (<a href="https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-R">https://github.com/TEOS-10/GSW-R</a>), which
is part of a set of sites dedicated to GSW formulations in
various languages.
</p>
<p>The <code>gsw</code> system is to link R functions with the C version of
the TEOS-10 library.  The R function names are chosen to match
those of the Matlab version of GSW, and the function arguments
also match with one exception: in <code>gsw</code>, longitude
and latitude are indicated with their full names, whereas in
Matlab they are indicated with <code>long</code> and <code>lat</code>;
since R permits abbreviated function arguments, the shortened
names can be used in <code>gsw</code> as well.
</p>
<p>The documentation for the <code>gsw</code> functions focuses mainly
on the arguments and return values, relying on links to the
TEOS-10 webpages for details.
</p>
<p>See <a href="http://www.teos-10.org/pubs/gsw/html/gsw_contents.html">http://www.teos-10.org/pubs/gsw/html/gsw_contents.html</a>
for a list of the TEOS-10 functions and
<a href="https://teos-10.github.io/GSW-R/reference/index.html">https://teos-10.github.io/GSW-R/reference/index.html</a>
for a list of the functions implemented in the present package.
</p>
<p>Each function is tested during the building of the package,
which means that results are guaranteed to match those of
the equivalent Matlab functions to at least 8 digits.
</p>
<p>A significant difference from the Matlab case is in the inspection
of the dimensions of arguments. The Matlab library has rules
for expanding some arguments to match others. For example,
if Practical Salinity is a matrix and pressure is a single value,
then that single pressure is used throughout a calculation of
Absolute Salinity. This convenience is only partly mimicked in the
present package.  Since the underlying C code works on vectors,
the R functions in <code>gsw</code> start by transforming the arguments accordingly.
This involves using <code>rep</code> on each argument to get something
with length matching the first argument, and, after the computation
is complete, converting the return value into a matrix, if the first
argument was a matrix. There are some exceptions to this, however.
For example, <code>gsw_SA_from_SP</code> and similar functions
can handle the case in which the <code>SA</code> argument is a matrix and
<code>longitude</code> and <code>latitude</code> are vectors sized to match.
This can be handy with gridded datasets. However, the careful
analyst will probably prefer to avoid this and other conveniences,
supplying properly-matched arguments from the outset.
