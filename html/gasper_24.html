<h2>NYC Taxi Network Dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset derived from NYC taxi trip records. Additionally, the dataset includes a signal <code>f</code> that represents the total amount with added noise.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">NYCdata
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A list with 2 elements:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>A</code>: NYC adjacency matrix, constructed using Gaussian weights based on mean distances between locations.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>f</code>: Signal representing the "total amount" with added artificial noise.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The graph constructed represents the connectivity based on taxi trips between different locations. The weights of the edges represent the frequency and distances of trips between locations.
</p>
<p>The data comes from the methodology in the referenced paper. It is constructed from real-world data fetched from NYC taxis databases. The graph consists of 265 vertices which correspond to different LocationID (both Pick-Up and Drop-Off points). Gaussian weights are defined by
</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">w_{ij} = \exp(-\tau d_{i,j}^2)</code>
</p>
<p>, where <code class="reqn">d_{i,j}</code> represents the mean distance taken on all the trips between locations <code class="reqn">i</code> and <code class="reqn">j</code> or <code class="reqn">j</code> and <code class="reqn">i</code>.
</p>
<p>The signal <code>f</code> is constructed based on the "total amount" variable from the taxi dataset, with added artificial noise.
