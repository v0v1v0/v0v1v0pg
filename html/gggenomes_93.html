<h2>Plot types of mutations with different offsets</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p><code>position_variant()</code> allows the user to plot the different mutation types (e.g. del, ins, snps) at different offsets from the base.
This can especially be useful to highlight in which regions certain types of mutations have higher prevalence.
This position adjustment is most relevant for the analysis/visualization of VCF files with the function <code>geom_variant()</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">position_variant(offset = c(del = 0.1, snp = 0, ins = -0.1), base = 0)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>offset</code></td>
<td>
<p>Shifts the data up/down based on the type of mutation.
By default <code>offset = c(del=0.1, snp=0, ins=-0.1)</code>.
The user can supply an own vector to <code>offset</code> to indicate at which offsets the different mutation types should be plotted.
<em>Types of mutations that have not been specified within the vector, will be plotted with an offset of 0.</em></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>base</code></td>
<td>
<p>How to align the offsets relative to the sequence. At base = 0, plotting of the offsets starts
from the sequence. <code>base</code> thus moves the entire feature up/down.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A ggproto object to be used in <code>geom_variant()</code>.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

p + geom_variant()

# Next lets use position_variant, and change the shape aesthetic by column `type`
p + geom_variant(aes(shape = type), position = position_variant())

# Now lets create a plot with different offsets by inserting a self-created vector.
p + geom_variant(

# Changing the base will shift all points up/down relatively from the sequence.
