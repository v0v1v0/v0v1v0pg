<h2>Greedy algorithm aimed to build a large weight cut in a
graph</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This routine uses a greedy algorithm to build a cut with large
weight.  This is a 2-approximation algorithm, which means that
the weight of the cut returned by this algorithm is larger
than half the maximum possible cut weight for a given graph.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">build_cut_greedy(G, w = NA)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>G</code></td>
<td>
<p>Graph</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>w</code></td>
<td>
<p>Weight matrix (defaults to NA).  It should be zero for
those edges not in G</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The algorithm builds a vertex subset S a step a a time.  It starts
with S = c(v1), and with vertices v1 and v2 marked.  Then it
iterates from vertex v3 to vn checking if the weight of the
edges joining vi with marked vertices belonging to S is less
than the weight of the edges joining vi with marked vertices
not belonging to S.  If the former weight is less than the
latter, then vi is adjoined to S.  At the end of each
iteration, vertex vi is marked.  When all vertices are marked
the algorithm ends and S is already built.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with four components: $set contains the subset of
V(g) representing the cut, $size contains the number of edges
of the cut, $weight contains the weight of the cut (which
coincides with $size if w is NA) and $cut contains the edges
of the cut, joining vertices inside $set with vertices outside
$set.

<pre><code class="language-R">## Example with known maximum cut
K10 &lt;- make_full_graph(10)   # Max cut of size 25
c0 &lt;- build_cut_greedy(K10)
c0$size  # 25
plot_cut(c0, K10)

## Max-cut of a random graph
