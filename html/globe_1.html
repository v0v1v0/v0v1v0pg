Simple 2D and 3D plots of Spheres including Earth
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A simple package to plot 2D and 3D views of a sphere.
Options include drawing Earth with
its major coastline, plotting the lines of longitude and latitude,
and plotting points and curves at any locations on the sphere.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This package provides very basic tools for plotting lines and points
on a sphere. It does not require installation of any other libraries.
</p>
<p>The major functions are <code>globeearth</code> to plot
a 3D view of a sphere (by default the Earth with its major coastline)
and <code>flatearth</code> to plot a 2D projection of the sphere.
</p>
<p>Additional tools include <code>globelines</code> and
<code>globepoints</code> to draw lines and points on the sphere.
</p>
