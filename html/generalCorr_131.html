<h2>kernel causality (version 2) scores with control variables</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function uses flipped kernel regressions to decide causal directions. 
This version 2 avoids Anderson's trapezoidal approximation used in
‘silenPairs.’ It calls functions: decileVote, momentVote, exactSdMtx, 
and summaryRank
after stochastic dominance is computed. It computes 
an average of ranks used. The column with the “choice” rank
value helps in choosing the flip having the lowest 
Hausman-Wu (residual times RHS regressor)
and secondly the lowest absolute 
residual. The chosen  flipped regression defines
the “cause" based on the variable on its right-hand side. In portfolio
selection, choice rank 1 has the highest return. Here we want low residuals and
low Hausman-Wu value, hence we choose choice=2 as the desirable flip.
</p>
<p>The function develops a unanimity index regarding the particular
flip (y on xi) or (xi on y) is best. A summary of all relevant signs determines the
causal direction and unanimity index among three criteria.
The ‘2’ in the name of the function suggests a second implementation
where exact stochastic dominance, decileVote, and momentVote algorithms are used.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">silentPair2(mtx, ctrl = 0, dig = 6)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>mtx</code></td>
<td>
<p>The data matrix with p columns. Denote x1 as the first column, 
which is fixed in all rows of the output and then it is
paired with all other columns, say: x2, x3, .., xp, one by one for the 
purpose of flipping with x1. p must be 2 or more</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>ctrl</code></td>
<td>
<p>data matrix for designated control variable(s) outside causal paths,
default is ctrl=0, which means that there are no control variables used.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dig</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of digits for reporting (default <code>dig</code>=6).</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A matrix with p columns in <code>mtx</code> argument to this function, x1 can be 
paired with a total of p-1 columns (x2, x3, .., xp). Note
we never flip any of the control variables with x1.  This function
produces i=1,2,..,p-1 numbers representing the summary sign, or ‘sum’ from 
the signs sg1 to sg3 associated with the three criteria:
Cr1, Cr2, and Cr3.  Note that sg1 and sg2 themselves are weighted signs using 
a weighted sum of signs from four orders of stochastic dominance.
In general, a positive sign in the i-th location of the ‘sum’ output of this function
means that x1 is the kernel cause while the variable in (i+1)-th column of <code>mtx</code> is the
‘effect’ or ‘response’ or ‘endogenous.’ The magnitude represents the strength (unanimity)
of the evidence for a particular sign. Conversely, a negative sign
in the i-th location of the ‘sum’ output of this function means 
that the first variable listed as the input to this function is the ‘effect,’
while the variable in (i+1)-th column of <code>mtx</code> is the exogenous kernel cause.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The European Crime data has all three criteria correctly suggesting that a
high crime rate kernel causes the deployment of a large number of police officers.
The command <code>attach(EuroCrime); silentPairs(cbind(crim,off))</code>
returns only one number: 3.175, implying the highest unanimity strength index,
with the positive sign suggesting ‘crim’ in the first column kernel causes
‘off’ in the second column of the argument <code>mtx</code> to this function.
