<h2>Authenticate as a GitHub App</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>GitHub <em>apps</em> provide a powerful way to manage fine grained programmatic access
to specific git repositories, without having to create dummy users, and which
are safer than PATs for automated tasks. This package extends gh::gh to let you
authenticate and interact with the GitHub API in R on behalf of an app.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">gh_app_info(jwt = gh_app_jwt())

gh_app_token(installation, jwt = gh_app_jwt())

gh_app_installation_count(jwt = gh_app_jwt())

gh_app_installation_list(jwt = gh_app_jwt())

gh_app_installation_info(installation, jwt = gh_app_jwt())

gh_app_installation_repositories(installation, jwt = gh_app_jwt())

gh_app_installation_delete(installation, jwt = gh_app_jwt())

gh_app_public_info(name = "r-universe")

gh_app_jwt(
  app_id = Sys.getenv("GH_APP_ID"),
  app_key = Sys.getenv("GH_APP_KEY")
)

gh_demo_jwt()
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>jwt</code></td>
<td>
<p>a jwt credential object generated with <code>gh_app_jwt()</code></p>
</td>

that has the app installed for example <code>"ropensci/magick"</code>.</p>

or a key object returned by openssl::read_key</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Instead of authenticating as a user, you can also authenticate with the GitHub
API as a "GitHub app". An app is a first class actor within GitHub. This means
it has its own permissions to specific repositories, without being tied to any
particular user account. In fact, you could think of an app as a special type
of dummy user with a specific purpose. Don't be too intimidated by the word
'app', it is mainly an authentication concept. Any program that authenticates
with GitHub, such as an R script, can be considered an app.
</p>


<h4>Creating a GitHub app</h4>

<p>To register a new app go to:
<a href="https://github.com/settings/apps/new">https://github.com/settings/apps/new</a>.
You may register as many apps as you like, with different permissions, for
different purposes.
</p>
<p>You can choose if the the app is public (to allow others to give the app access
to their repo by "installing" the app) or if the app is only for your own
account. The latter is basically a safe way to provide limited access to a
single repository, without exposing your user account in any way.
</p>



<h4>Acting on behalf of an app in R</h4>

<p>We can interact with <a href="https://docs.github.com/en/rest/overview/endpoints-available-for-github-apps">most of the GitHub API</a>
on behalf of an app in exactly the same way as a regular user. The only
difference is that instead of a personal access token (PAT) we generate a
temporary app token, which looks very similar. From here we use <code>gh::gh()</code> in
exactly the same way as usual.
</p>
<p>Authentication on behalf of an app is a two step process. First you need to
generate a so-called JWT with <code>gh_app_jwt()</code> using the App-ID and a RSA key file
that you can retrieve on GitHub in the app settings. This JWT is only valid for
5 minutes, and is used to generate app tokens for specific target repositories
with <code>gh_app_token()</code>. This app token works the same as a PAT, but it is valid
for 1 hour and has permission only to the repository that you specified as the
<code>installations</code> parameter in <code>gh_app_token()</code>. From here you can use <code>gh::gh()</code> to
perform all the operations that the git repository has given your app permission
for.
</p>



<h4>Using this in CI</h4>

<p>A common use case is to authenticate as a github-app inside a github action script,
in order to run tasks that require authentication, without the need to use someones
personal credentials. To make this easy, you can specify the app-id and private key
via environment variables <code>GH_APP_ID</code> and <code>GH_APP_KEY</code> which you can expose as a
'secret' in the CI. The <code>GH_APP_KEY</code> can either be a file path, or simply the
verbatim content of the private key (pem) file.
</p>



<h3>Value</h3>

<p><code>gh_app_token</code> returns a temporary token that will be valid for 1 hour
that you use instead of a PAT.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Authenitcate and show some metadata about our demo-app
gh_app_info(jwt = gh_demo_jwt())
gh_app_installation_list(jwt = gh_demo_jwt())

# This requires that user 'testingjerry' has our app installed:
gh_app_installation_info('testingjerry', jwt = gh_demo_jwt())
token &lt;- gh_app_token('testingjerry', jwt = gh_demo_jwt())

# Use the token in gh() to do things on behalf of the app
res &lt;- gh::gh('/users/testingjerry', .token = token)

</code></pre>
