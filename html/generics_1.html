<h2>generics: common S3 generics</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>These are generic functions that can be used to minimize
package dependencies when multiple packages have the same
method.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>An attempt was made to use generic class signatures that were
consistent with existing code. For example, <span class="pkg">dplyr</span> and
<span class="pkg">lime</span> both have <code>explain()</code> methods that do very different
things but both take <code>x</code> as their main object. Even though <code>x</code>
would be different in those cases, this package provides access
to the S3 generic so that other packages that may want to create
<code>explain()</code> methods for their objects can do so without loading
either of the other packages.
</p>
<p>For example, if a new <code>tidy()</code> method is being developed for a
package, this lightweight package can be the required dependency
to have access to the generic method (instead of depending on
<span class="pkg">broom</span> and installing its dependencies).
</p>
