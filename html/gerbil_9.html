<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Prints a <code>cor_gerbil</code> object. Printed output includes the average difference of correlations, as well as summaries of the test statistics based on Fisher's z and their p-values.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">## S3 method for class 'cor_gerbil'
print(x, ...)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>object of <code>cor_gerbil</code> class</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>...</code></td>

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The functions <code>print.cor_gerbil</code> and <code>summary.cor_gerbil</code> display information 
about the <code>cor_gerbil</code> object. The output displayed includes: 
1) the average absolute difference in correlation between observed and imputed cases across all relevant variable pairs,
2) the average value of the test statistic based on Fisher's z across all variable pairs,
3) the largest test statistic observed across any variable pair, and
4) the portion of p-values for the test based on Fisher's z that are less than 0.05.
