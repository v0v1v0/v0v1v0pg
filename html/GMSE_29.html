<h2>Plot the results of a gmse simulation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Produce six panels on a plot showing resource distribution, owned land, resource dynamics and estimates, stake-holder yield, and action costs and actions made.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">plot_gmse_results(sim_results)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sim_results</code></td>
<td>
<p>Output from gmse to be plotted.</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>This function plots the dynamics of GMSE resource, observation, managemer, and user models in six separate sub-panels. (1) Upper left panel: Shows the locations of resources on the landscape (black dots); landscape terrain is also shown in brown, but at the moment, this is only cosmetic and does not reflect anything occurring in the model. (2) Upper right panel: Shows ownership of land by agents; land is divided proportional based on parameters set in gmse() and colours correspond with other subplots. If agent utilities and actions are restricted to land ('land_ownership' in the gmse() function), then this gives some idea of where actions are being performed and where resources are affecting the landscape. (3) Middle left panel: Shows the actual population abundance (black solid line) and the population abundance estimated by the manager (blue solid line; shading indicates 95 percent confidence intervals) over time. The dotted red line shows the resource carrying capacity (death-based) and the dotted blue line shows the target for resource abundance as set in the gmse() function; the orange line shows the total percent yield of the landscape (i.e., 100 percent means that resources have not decreased yield at all, 0 percent means that resources have completely destroyed all yield). (4) Middle right panel: Shows the raw landscape yield for each stakeholder (can be ignored if 'land_ownership' is FALSE) over time; colours correspond to land ownership shown in the upper right panel. (5) Lower left panel: The cost of stakeholders performing actions over time, as set by the manager. (6) Lower right panel: The total number of actions performed by all stakeholders over time.
