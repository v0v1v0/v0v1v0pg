</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">checkSwitchAppearance(code)
</code></pre>

</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with three elements: switches, appearance and type. Switches
is a vector containing all switches. The names of the vector contain the
information where the switch is set. Appearance is a matrix containing
values which indicate whether an object appears in a part of the code or not
(e.g. indicates whether "vm_example" appears in realization "on" of module
"test" or not.). 0 means that it does not appear, 1 means that it appears in
the code and 2 means that it appears in the not_used.txt. Type is a vector
containing the type of each object.
