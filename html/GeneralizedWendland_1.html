<h2>Fully Parametrized Generalized Covariance Function for R</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package provides a fully parametrized generalized Wendland covariance function for use in geostatistical modeling, as well as various options for approximations and adjustments. In addition, the package comes with a modified process for parameter estimation, based on the spam-implementations, but compartmentalized using function factories.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The package requires the user to complete some initial steps before it can be used. Apart from the R dependencies, the user will need to manually install the GNU Scientific Library on their system and ensure that R can find the required libraries. On Windows systems, users can install devtools and then install gsl via MSYS2 &gt; pacman.
