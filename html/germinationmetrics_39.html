<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Timson's index (Timson 1965) is computed
as follows
(Grose and Zimmer 1958; Brown and Mayer 1988; Baskin and Baskin 1998).
</p>
\[\Sigma k = \sum_{i=1}^{k}G_{i}\]
<p>Where, \(G_{i}\) is the cumulative germination percentage in time
interval \(i\) and \(k\) is the total number of time intervals.
</p>
<p>For example ten summation (\(\Sigma 10\)) is expressed as follows.
</p>
\[\Sigma 10 = G_{1}+G_{2}+\cdots+G_{10}\]
<p>Where \(G_{1},G_{2},\cdots G_{10}\) are the cumulative germination
percentage at day 1, 2, 3, \(\cdots\), 10 respectively.
</p>
<p>Similarly \(\Sigma 5\) or \(\Sigma 20\) can be estimated. For
\(\Sigma 10\), the value can range from 0 (no germination) to 1,000
(100% germination after 24 hours).
</p>
<p>It is the progressive total of cumulative germination percentage recorded at
specific intervals for a set period of time.  It combines onset, rate and
total percentage of germination and estimates the area under the cumulative
germination percentage curve. It is same as the indices for area under time
course curve of germination described by
Lyon and Coffelt (1966) as
well as Negm and Smith (1978). It is
also described as Emergence Rate Index (\(ERI\)) by
Chaudhary and Ghildyal (1970).
</p>
<p>Goodchild and Walker (1971), described the
same in terms of partial germination percentage as follows.
</p>
\[\Sigma k = \sum_{i=1}^{k}g_{i}(k-j)\]
<p>Where, \(g_{i}\) is the germination (not cumulative, but partial
germination) in time interval \(i\) (\(i\) varying from \(0\)
to \(k\)), \(k\) is the total number of time intervals, and
\(j = i - 1\).
</p>
<p>Timson's index is equivalent to the Germination Energy Index \(GEI\)
proposed by Grose and Zimmer (1958).
</p>
<p>As Timson's index is useful for comparison only when samples have similar
germinabilities or final germination percentage, the following modification
was suggested by Labouriau (Ranal and de Santana 2006)
(Specified by the argument <code>modification = "labouriau"</code>).
</p>
\[\Sigma k_{mod} = \frac{\Sigma k}{\sum_{i=1}^{k}g_{i}}\]
<p>Here Timson's index (\(\Sigma k\)) is divided by the sum of partial
germination percentages.
</p>
<p>Similarly another modification was proposed by
(Khan and Ungar 1984), where Timson's index
(\(\Sigma k\)) is divided by the total time period of germination
(\(T_{k}\)) (Specified by the argument <code>modification =
"khanungar"</code>).
</p>
\[\Sigma k_{mod} = \frac{\Sigma k}{T_{k}}\]
<p>Timson's index is similar to the Germination Rate (\(GR\)) proposed by
George (1961) as follows
(Tucker and Wright 1965; Nichols and Heydecker 1968).
</p>
\[GR = \sum_{i=1}^{k}N_{i}K_{i}\]
<p>Where \(N_{i}\) is the number of seeds germinated by \(i\)th
interval, \(K_{i}\) is the number of intervals(e.g. days) until the end
of the test, and \(k\) is the total number of time intervals.
</p>
<p>This index uses number of seeds germinated instead of germination percentage.
It is also described as Emergence Rate Index (\(ERI\)) by
Chopra and Chaudhary (1980).
</p>
<p>So germination rate (\(GR\)) can also be described in terms of partial
(\(N_{i}\)) and cumulative (\(\sum_{j=1}^{i}N_{j}\)) number of
seeds germinated in each time interval (\(i\)) as follows.
</p>
\[GR = \sum_{i=1}^{k}\sum_{j=1}^{i}N_{j}\]
\[GR = \sum_{i=1}^{k}N_{i}(k-j)\]


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>For <code>TimsonsIndex</code>, the value of Timson's index (%) if
<code>modification = "none"</code>. If <code>modification = "labouriau"</code>, then
value with no unit and if <code>modification = "khanungar"</code>, then value as
% \(\mathrm{time^{-1}}\).
</p>
<p>For <code>GermRateGeorge</code> The value of George's germination rate as
\(count time\).
