<h2>sconduct: Generalized Path Analysis for Social Networks</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package contains two categories of functions. The first category is concerned
with assigning values to user specified paths, while the second identifies
paths of optimal value.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Key functions in the path value calculation category are
- <code>gpv</code>, which calculates Generalized Path Value
- <code>ppv</code>, which calculates Probabilistic Path Value
- <code>binary_distance</code>, <code>peay_path_value</code>, <code>flament_path_length</code>,
<code>peay_average_path_value</code>, and <code>flament_average_path_length</code>, which
calculate path value measures described in <em>Yang, Knoke</em> (2001).
- <code>generate_proximities</code>, which generates a matrix of values representing the
measures of optimal paths from each source node (row index) to each target node 
(column index).
</p>
<p>Key functions in the optimal path identification category are
- <code>opt_gpv</code>, which identifies the path of optimal Generalized Path Value from 
a particular source node to a particular target node
- <code>opt_ppv</code>, which identifies the path of optimal Probabilistic Path Value from
a particular source node to a particular target node
- <code>all_opt_gpv</code>, which identifies the 'gpv'-optimal paths from every source node 
to every target node
- <code>all_opt_ppv</code>, which identifies the 'ppv'-optimal paths from every source node
to every target node
- <code>unpack</code>, which unpacks the Dijkstra-format encoded shortest paths returned by
<code>all_opt_gpv</code> and <code>all_opt_ppv</code>. See their help pages for details.
