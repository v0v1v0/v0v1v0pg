<h2>ggDoubleHeat: Data visualization for two sources</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>ggDoubleHeat, which is a ggplot2 extension, provides
visualization for a reformed heatmap. Instead of facetting heatmaps by data
sources, they can be combined together for making one single heatmap,
generated by <code>geom_heat_*()</code> functions built in the package. Prior to
using the package, users should load ggplot2.
</p>


<h3>ggDoubleHeat functions</h3>

<p>All functions in the package are named as <code>geom_heat_*()</code>, making the
naming convention consistent. Also, the arguments for functions are
relatively similar, although with slight variations due to where a specific
argument will connect to the position of the rendering plot. Users should
reference the documentation and possibly run examples presented in the help
file when trying to understand what each argument means visually.
