<h2>NDVI errors for a portion of southwestern Oregon, USA.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A raster image of Normalized Difference
Vegetation Index (NDVI) errors derived from Landsat
data for a small portion of SW Oregon state. This
raster was calculated by subtracting the best-fit polynomial
plane from the <code>orforest</code> values. The best-fit
polynomial plane was calculated using <code>bestfitplane</code>.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>NDVI values are derived from Landsat scene path 45,
row 30 summarized as the mean NDVI value between June
and August 2000 at roughly 30m resolution. Clouds
were removed from the Landsat scene before calculating
the mean. The image was created using Google Earth
Engine in August 2018.
