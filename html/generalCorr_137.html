<h2>Kernel causality computations admitting control variables.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function reports a 7-column matrix (has the older version of criterion Cr1).
It allows an additional input matrix having control variables. It
produces a 7-column matrix
summarizing the results, where the signs of
stochastic dominance order values (+1 or -1) are weighted 
by <code>wt=c(1.2,1.1, 1.05, 1)</code> to
compute an overall result for all orders of stochastic dominance 
by a weighted sum for
the criteria Cr1 and Cr2. The weighting is obviously not needed for 
the third criterion Cr3 which compares asymmetric correlation coefficients.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">someCPairs(
  mtx,
  ctrl,
  dig = 6,
  verbo = TRUE,
  rnam = FALSE,
  wt = c(1.2, 1.1, 1.05, 1),
  sumwt = 4
)
</code></pre>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The reason for slightly declining weights on the signs from
SD1 to SD4 is somewhat arbitrary.
The summary results for all
three criteria are reported in one matrix called <code>outVote</code>: 
</p>
<p>typ=1 reports ('Y', 'X', 'Cause',
'SD1apdC', 'SD2apdC', 'SD3apdC', 'SD4apdC') naming variables identifying 'cause'
and measures of stochastic dominance using absolute values of kernel
regression gradients (or amorphous partial derivatives, apd-s) being minimized by
the kernel regression algorithm while
comparing the kernel regression of X on Y with that of Y on X.
The letter C in the titles reminds presence of control variable(s).
</p>
<p>typ=2 reports ('Y', 'X', 'Cause', 'SD1resC', 'SD2resC', 'SD3resC', 'SD4resC')
and measures of stochastic dominance using absolute values of kernel
regression residuals comparing regression of X on Y with that of Y on X.
</p>
<p>typ=3 reports ('Y', 'X', 'Cause', 'r*x|yC', 'r*y|xC', 'r', 'p-val')
containing generalized correlation coefficients r*, 'r' refers to.
Pearson correlation coefficient p-val is the p-value for 
testing the significance of 'r'. 
The letter C in the titles reminds the presence of control variable(s).
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Prints three matrices detailing results for Cr1, Cr2 and Cr3.
It also returns a grand summary matrix called ‘outVote’ which summarizes all three criteria.
In general, a positive sign for weighted sum reported in the column ‘sum’ means
that the first variable listed as the input to this function is the ‘kernel cause.’ 
This function is an extension of <code>some0Pairs</code> to allow for control variables. 
For example, crime ‘kernel causes’ police officer deployment (not vice versa) is indicated by 
the positive sign of ‘sum’ (=3.175) reported for that example included in this package.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The output matrix last column for ‘mtcars’ example
has the sum of the scores by the three criteria
combined. If ‘sum’ is positive, then variable X (mpg) is more likely to have been
engineerd to kernel cause the response variable Y, rather than vice versa.
</p>
<p>The European Crime data has all three criteria correctly suggesting that
high crime rate kernel causes the deployment of a large number of police officers.
