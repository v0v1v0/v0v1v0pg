<h2>checkAppearance</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Checks for all declared objects in which parts of the model they appear and
calculates the type of each object (core object, interface object, module
object of module xy,...)
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">checkAppearance(x, capitalExclusionList = NULL)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A code list as returned by <code>codeExtract</code></p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>capitalExclusionList</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of names that should be ignored when
checking for unified capitalization of variables</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with four elements: appearance, setappearance, type and
warnings. Appearance is a matrix containing values which indicate whether an
object appears in a part of the code or not (e.g. indicates whether "vm_example"
appears in realization "on" of module "test" or not.). 0 means that it does not appear,
1 means that it appears in the code and 2 means that it appears in the
not_used.txt. setappearance contains the same information but for sets instead of other
objects. Type is a vector containing the type of each object (exluding sets). And warnings
contains a list of warnings created during that process.
