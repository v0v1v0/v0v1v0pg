<h2>Register a Stadia Maps API Key</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This page contains documentation for tools related to enabling Stadia Maps
services in R. See the Details section of this file for background
information.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">register_stadiamaps(key, write = FALSE)

stadiamaps_key()

has_stadiamaps_key()
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>key</code></td>
<td>
<p>an api key</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>write</code></td>
<td>
<p>if TRUE, stores the secrets provided in the .Renviron file</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>To obtain an API key and enable services, go to
<a href="https://client.stadiamaps.com/signup/">https://client.stadiamaps.com/signup/</a>. It is completely free for non-commercial
and evaluation use (a license is for commercial use; see <a href="https://stadiamaps.com/pricing">https://stadiamaps.com/pricing</a>
for pricing), and no credit card is required to sign up.
</p>
<p>To tell ggmap about your API key, use <code>register_stadiamaps()</code>, e.g.
<code>register_stadiamaps(key = "YOUR-API-KEY")</code> (that's a
fake key). This will set your API key for the current session, but if you
restart R, you'll need to do it again. You can set it permanently by setting
<code>write = TRUE</code>, see the examples. If you set it permanently it will be stored
in your .Renviron file, and that will be accessed by ggmap persistently
across sessions.
</p>
<p>Users should be aware that the API key, is a PRIVATE key - it uniquely identifies and
authenticates you to Stadia Maps' services. If anyone gets your API key, they can
use it to masquerade as you to Stadia Maps and potentially use services that you
have enabled. While Stadia Maps requires you to opt in to additional usage-based billing,
this also means that anyone who obtains your key can potentially incur charges on your behalf
or steal the quota that you have already purchased. So be
sure to not share your API key. To mitigate against users inadvertently
sharing their keys, by default ggmap never displays a user's key in messages
displayed to the console.
</p>
<p>Users should also be aware that ggmap has no mechanism with which to
safeguard the private key once registered with R. That is to say, once you
register your API key, any function R will have access to it. As a
consequence, ggmap will not know if another function, potentially from a
compromised package, accesses the key and uploads it to a third party. For
this reason, when using ggmap we recommend a heightened sense of security and
self-awareness: only use trusted packages, do not save API keys in script
files, routinely cycle keys (regenerate new keys and retire old ones), etc.
