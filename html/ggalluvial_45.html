<h2>Influenza vaccination survey responses</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This data set is aggregated from three RAND American Life Panel (ALP) surveys
that asked respondents their probability of vaccinating for influenza. Their
responses were discretized to "Never" (0%), "Always" (100%), or "Sometimes"
(any other value). After merging, missing responses were coded as "Missing"
and respondents were grouped and counted by all three coded responses. The
pre-processed data were kindly contributed by Raffaele Vardavas, and the
complete surveys are freely available at the ALP website.
