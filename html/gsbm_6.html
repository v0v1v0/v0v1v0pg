<h2>Network of interactions within a primary school in the course of a day</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This network, collected and analyzed by J. Stehle et al. in "High-resolution measurements of face-to-face contact patterns in a primary school", records physical interactions between 226 children and 10 teachers within a primary school over the course of a day. The network data was collected using a system of sensors worn by the participants. This system records the duration of interactions between two individuals facing each other at a maximum distance of one and a half meters.
