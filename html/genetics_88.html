<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The <code>power.casectl</code> function contained serious errors.  For some
time, replacements were provided by the BioConductor GeneticsDesign package.
</p>
<p>In specific, the <code>power.casectl</code> function used an expected
contingency table to create the test statistic that was
erroneously based on the underlying null, rather than on the
marginal totals of the observed table. In addition, the modeling of
dominant and recessive modes of inheritance had assumed a "perfect" 
genotype with no disease, whereas in reality a dominant or recessive
mode of inheritance simply means that two of the genotypes will have
an identical odds ratio compared to the 3rd genotype (the other
homozygote).
