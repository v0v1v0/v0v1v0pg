<h2>Growth rates of snails on large boulders on different rock shores</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This design was extracted from Underwood (1997), but data are artificial.
Snails were transplanted from origin to different shores. Several boulders
were used on each shore. Cages with snails of each origin on each boulder
were replicated. All factors (origin, shore, boulder and cage) are random.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(snails)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 240 rows and 6 variables
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>


<ul>
<li>
<p> origin: a random factor with two levels (<code>O1, O2</code>)
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> shore: a random factor with four levels (<code>S1, S2, S3, S4</code>) orthogonal to origin
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> boulder: a random factor with three levels (<code>B1, B2, B3</code>) nested in shore
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> cage: a random factor with two levels (<code>C1, C2</code>) nested in the combination of boulder and origin
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> replicate: sample size
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> growth: response variable
</p>
</li>
</ul>
