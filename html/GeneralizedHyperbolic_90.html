<h2>Intervals Between Pulses Along a Nerve Fibre</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Times between successive electric pulses on the surface of isolated
muscle fibres.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(nervePulse)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>The <code>nervePulse</code> data is a vector with 799 observations.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The end-plates of resting muscle fibres are the seat of spontaneous
electric discharges. The occurence of these spontaneous discharges at
apparently normal synapses is studied in depth in Fatt and Katz
(1951).
The frequency and amplitute of these discharges was recorded. The
times between each discharge were taken in milliseconds and this has
been converted into the number of 1/50 sec intervals between
successive pulses.
There are 799 observations.
