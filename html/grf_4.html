<h2>Get doubly robust estimates of average treatment effects.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In the case of a causal forest with binary treatment, we provide
estimates of one of the following:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> The average treatment effect (target.sample = all): E[Y(1) - Y(0)]
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The average treatment effect on the treated (target.sample = treated): E[Y(1) - Y(0) | Wi = 1]
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The average treatment effect on the controls (target.sample = control): E[Y(1) - Y(0) | Wi = 0]
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> The overlap-weighted average treatment effect (target.sample = overlap):
E[e(X) (1 - e(X)) (Y(1) - Y(0))] / E[e(X) (1 - e(X)), where e(x) = P[Wi = 1 | Xi = x].
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>This last estimand is recommended by Li, Morgan, and Zaslavsky (2018)
in case of poor overlap (i.e., when the propensities e(x) may be very close
to 0 or 1), as it doesn't involve dividing by estimated propensities.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">average_treatment_effect(
  forest,
  target.sample = c("all", "treated", "control", "overlap"),
  method = c("AIPW", "TMLE"),
  subset = NULL,
  debiasing.weights = NULL,
  compliance.score = NULL,
  num.trees.for.weights = 500
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>forest</code></td>
<td>
<p>The trained forest.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>target.sample</code></td>
<td>
<p>Which sample to aggregate treatment effects over.
Note: Options other than "all" are only currently implemented
for causal forests.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>method</code></td>
<td>
<p>Method used for doubly robust inference. Can be either
augmented inverse-propensity weighting (AIPW), or
targeted maximum likelihood estimation (TMLE). Note:
TMLE is currently only implemented for causal forests with
a binary treatment.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>subset</code></td>
<td>
<p>Specifies subset of the training examples over which we
estimate the ATE. WARNING: For valid statistical performance,
the subset should be defined only using features Xi, not using
the treatment Wi or the outcome Yi.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>debiasing.weights</code></td>
<td>
<p>A vector of length n (or the subset length) of debiasing weights.
If NULL (default) these are obtained via the appropriate doubly robust score
construction, e.g., in the case of causal_forests with a binary treatment, they
are obtained via inverse-propensity weighting.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>compliance.score</code></td>
<td>
<p>Only used with instrumental forests. An estimate of the causal
effect of Z on W, i.e., Delta(X) = E[W | X, Z = 1] - E[W | X, Z = 0],
which can then be used to produce debiasing.weights. If not provided,
this is estimated via an auxiliary causal forest.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>num.trees.for.weights</code></td>
<td>
<p>In some cases (e.g., with causal forests with a continuous
treatment), we need to train auxiliary forests to learn debiasing weights.
This is the number of trees used for this task. Note: this argument is only
used when debiasing.weights = NULL.</p>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>In the case of a causal forest with continuous treatment, we provide estimates of the
average partial effect, i.e., E[Cov[W, Y | X] / Var[W | X]]. In the case of a binary treatment,
the average partial effect matches the average treatment effect. Computing the average partial
effect is somewhat more involved, as the relevant doubly robust scores require an estimate
of Var[Wi | Xi = x]. By default, we get such estimates by training an auxiliary forest;
however, these weights can also be passed manually by specifying debiasing.weights.
</p>
<p>In the case of instrumental forests with a binary treatment, we provide an estimate
of the the Average (Conditional) Local Average Treatment (ACLATE).
Specifically, given an outcome Y, treatment W and instrument Z, the (conditional) local
average treatment effect is tau(x) = Cov[Y, Z | X = x] / Cov[W, Z | X = x].
This is the quantity that is estimated with an instrumental forest.
It can be intepreted causally in various ways. Given a homogeneity
assumption, tau(x) is simply the CATE at x. When W is binary
and there are no "defiers", Imbens and Angrist (1994) show that tau(x) can
be interpreted as an average treatment effect on compliers. This function
provides and estimate of tau = E[tau(X)]. See Chernozhukov
et al. (2016) for a discussion, and Section 5.2 of Athey and Wager (2021)
for an example using forests.
</p>
<p>If clusters are specified, then each unit gets equal weight by default. For
example, if there are 10 clusters with 1 unit each and per-cluster ATE = 1,
and there are 10 clusters with 19 units each and per-cluster ATE = 0, then
the overall ATE is 0.05 (additional sample.weights allow for custom
weighting). If equalize.cluster.weights = TRUE each cluster gets equal weight
and the overall ATE is 0.5.
