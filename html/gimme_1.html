<h2>Group iterative multiple model estimation</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package contains functions to automatically identify the structure of group- and individual-level networks 
from a range of vector autoregressive models, estimated with structural equation modeling.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Researchers across varied domains gather multivariate data for each individual unit of study
across multiple occasions of measurement. Generally referred to as time series
(or in the social sciences, intensive longitudinal) data, examples include
psychophysiological processes such as neuroimaging and heart rate variability,
daily diary studies, ecological momentary assessments, data passively collected from devices such as smartphones, 
and observational coding of social interactions among dyads.
</p>
<p>A primary goal for acquiring these data is to understand dynamic processes.
The gimme package contains several functions for use with these data.
These functions include <code>gimmeSEM</code>, which provides both group-
and individual-level results by looking across individuals for patterns of
relations among variables. A function that provides group-level results,
<code>aggSEM</code>, is included, as well as a function that provides
individual-level results, <code>indSEM</code>. The major functions within the gimme package all require the
user to specify the data, although many additional options exist.
