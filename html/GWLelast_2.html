<h2>GWLelast
Geographically weighted logistic elastic net regression</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This pacakge fits the geographically weighted logistic elastic net regression model for a valible seelction and for the mitigatin of the multicolinearity between coefficients due to geographical correlation. Detailed explanations can be found in Yoneoka et al. (2016): New algorithm for constructing area-based index with geographical heterogeneities and variable selection: An application to gastric cancer screening.
