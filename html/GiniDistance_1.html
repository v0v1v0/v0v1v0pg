<h2>GiniDistance</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A new Gini correlation to measure dependence between categorical and numerical variables are implemented. Analogous to Pearson in ANOVA model, the Gini
correlation is interpreted as the ratio of the between-group variation and the total
variation, but it characterizes independence (zero Gini correlation mutually implies
independence). Closely related to the distance correlation, the Gini correlation is of the simple formulation by considering the nature of the categorical variable. As a result, the
Gini correlation has a lower computational cost than the distance correlation and is more straightforward to perform inference. The dependence test and confidence interval are implemented. 
Also, the corresponding kernelized dependence measures are also implemented.
