<h2>ggarrow extensions to ggplot2</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>ggarrow relieas on the extension mechanism of ggplot2 through
ggproto class objects, that allow for cross-package
inheritance of geoms. These objects can be ignored by users for the purpose
of making plots, since interacting with these objects is preferred through
various <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠geom_*()⁠</code> functions.
