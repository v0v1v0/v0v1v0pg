<h2>Data from an ELISA assay</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Observed signals and (for some observations) nominal concentrations for
samples that were aliquoted to multiple assay plates, which were read
multiple times on multiple days.
</p>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>a data frame with the following columns:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> PlateDay factor. Specifies one of four physically distinct 96 well plates
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Read factor. The signal was read 3 times for each plate.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Description character. Indicates contents of sample.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> Concentration numeric. Nominal concentration of standards (NA for all other samples).
