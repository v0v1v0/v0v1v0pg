<h2>
Leaving A Modified Viewport Context
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A modified viewport context is where the appearance of grobs is no
longer determined solely by the grob itself and the viewport into
which they're drawn. This can occur when applying clipping paths and
opacity masks, which modify the appearance of anything drawn after
they have been applied. This function should be used when attempting
to stop the effect of a modified viewport context (e.g. to stop
clipping to paths).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">popContext(n = 1)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>

<p>The number of contexts to pop. A warning will be given when <code>n</code>
is greater than the number that has been applied.
</p>
</td>
</tr></table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Popping a context can produce a warning. In this case it is
recommended that the context "pushing" and "popping" be revised to
have matching pairs of pushes and pops.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>None.
