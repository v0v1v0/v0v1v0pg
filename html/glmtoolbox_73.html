<h2>Ability of retinyl acetate to prevent mammary cancer in rats</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A total of 76 female rats were injected with a carcinogen
for mammary cancer. Then, all animals were given retinyl acetate
(retinoid) to prevent mammary cancer for 60 days. After this phase,
the 48 animals that remained tumor-free were randomly assigned to
continue retinoid prophylaxis or control. Rats were then palpated for
tumors twice weekly, and observations ended 182 days after initial
carcinogen injections began. The main objective of the analysis was
to assess the difference in tumor development between the treated
and control groups.
