<h2>Git Add</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Prints all changed files since last commit and waits for you to hit
ENTER to add everything, or type out the space-separated numbers of
what you do want to add to the next commit, else ESCAPE to cancel.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">git_add()
</code></pre>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Files can are selected by number by typing a list of space-separated
values. The inverse can also be used, for example "-2 -4" would add all
<em>except</em> the 2nd and 4th file.
</p>
<p>Each file or directory is given a symbol for change type:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>-</code> has been deleted
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>+</code> has been created
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>*</code> has been changed since <code>git_add()</code> was last called and should be re-added
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>@</code> has been renamed, but this will often show as a pair of <code>+</code> and <code>-</code>
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code style="white-space: pre;">⁠?⁠</code> contains conflict from latest merge; go in and edit by hand, searching
for "&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD" up to "&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; (some branch)"
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For any file which has been flagged by <code>git_pull()</code> or <code>git_merge()</code> as containing
conflicts, these are <em>not</em> included by hitting ENTER and must be added by number.
This is to reduce the risk of accidentally committing a whole load of conflicts.
Each file should be inspected manually before adding.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Invisible NULL
</p>
