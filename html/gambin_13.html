<h2>Fit the gambin model to species abundance distributions</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package provides functions for fitting unimodal and
multimodal gambin distributions to species-abundance distributions from
ecological data. The main function is <code>fit_abundances()</code>, which
estimates the 'alpha' parameter(s) of the gambin distribution using maximum
likelihood.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The gambin distribution is a sample distribution based on a
stochastic model of species abundances, and has been demonstrated to fit
empirical data better than the most commonly used species-abundance models
(see references). Gambin is a stochastic model which combines the gamma
distribution with a binomial sampling method. To fit the gambin
distribution, the abundance data is first binned into octaves. The expected
abundance octave of a species is given by the number of successful
consecutive Bernoulli trials with a given parameter <code>p</code>. The parameter
<code>p</code> of species is assumed to distributed according to a gamma
distribution. This approach can be viewed as linking the gamma distribution
with the probability of success in a binomial process with x trials. Use
the <code>fit_abundances()</code> function to fit the gambin model to a vector of
species abundances, optionally using a subsample of the individuals. Use
the <code>mult_abundances()</code> function to fit the gambin model to multiple
sites / samples and return the alpha values for each model fit (both the
raw values and the alpha values standardised by the number of
individuals).The package estimates the alpha (shape) parameter with
associated confidence intervals. Methods are provided for plotting the
results, and for calculating the likelihood of fits.
</p>
<p>The package now provides functionality to fit multimodal gambin
distributions (i.e. a gambin distribution with more than one mode), and to
deconstruct and examine a multimodal gambin model fit
(<code>deconstruct_modes</code>).
