Discovers featured patterns in two groups of strings
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>FeaturedPatt discovers featured patterns that are in one group of strings.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">FeaturedPatt(grp1_pattern, grp2_pattern, grp1_string, grp2_string)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>grp1_pattern</code></td>
<td>

<p>Patterns shared by a certain percent of strings in string group 1.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>grp2_pattern</code></td>
<td>

<p>Patterns shared by a certain percent of strings in string group 2.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>grp1_string</code></td>
<td>

<p>String group 1.
</p>
</td>

<td>

<p>String group 2.
</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>A (common) pattern is defined as a substring with the minimum length of three
that occurs at least twice among a group of strings.
</p>
<p>In practice, a pattern usually is not shared by all the strings in a group.
Thus, featured patterns may be obtained from two pattern vectors, each of which contains patterns that are shared by a certain percent of strings in a group.
As a result, featured patterns can possibly appear in both groups of strings,
athough ideally, a featured pattern should only appears in one of the two groups of strings.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The function exports five text files:
</p>
<p>File that lists featured patterns: column 1 for string group 1; column 2 for string group 2.
</p>
<p>Four files that contain information about each group of patterns in each group of strings.
</p>
<p>The information includes the number of each of the patterns in each string and the starting
</p>
<p>positions of the first occurring patterns, as well as the lengths of original strings.
</p>
<p>If a pattern does not appear in a string, -1 is returned.
</p>
<p>In the above four files: the first column contains original strings;
the second column contains the length of strings;
the third column contains the number of featured patterns each string has; 
each of the columns from the fourth is the starting position of a pattern that first appears in a string.
</p>
<p>In addition, messages are printed out for the four situations of each pattern group in each string group.
The messages include the number and the ratio of strings that have at least one featured pattern.
