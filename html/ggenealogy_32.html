<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Soybean genealogical data
</p>
<p>This data contains information on copy number variants, single nucleotide polymorphisms, protein content, and yield, of soybeans. The available data consists of a data frame structure that contains 412 direct child-parent relationships between pairs of soybean varieties. These data were collected from field trials, genetic studies, and United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) bulletins, and date as early as the first decade of the 1900s.
