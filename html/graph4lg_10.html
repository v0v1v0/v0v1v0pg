<h2>data_simul_genind genetic dataset</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Genetic dataset from genetic simulation on CDPOP
1500 individuals, 50 populations
20 microsatellite loci (3 digits coding)
50 generations simulated
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data_simul_genind
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>An object of type 'genind'
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The simulation was made with CDPOP during 50 generations.
Dispersal was possible between the 50 populations. Its probability depended
on the cost distance between populations, calculated on a simulated
resistance surface (raster). Mutations were not possible. There
were initially 600 alleles in total (many disappeared because of drift).
Population stayed constant
with a sex-ratio of 1. Generations did not overlap.
This simulation includes a part of stochasticity and these data result
from only 1 simulation run.
