<h2>
Fitting the Generalized and Variable Persistence Models
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An EM algorithm, Karl et al. (2013) &lt;doi:10.1016/j.csda.2012.10.004&gt;, is used to estimate the generalized, variable, and complete persistence models, Mariano et al. (2010) &lt;doi:10.3102/1076998609346967&gt;. These are multiple-membership linear mixed models with teachers modeled as "G-side" effects and students modeled with either "G-side" or "R-side" effects.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">GPvam(vam_data, fixed_effects = formula(~as.factor(year) + 0), 
   student.side = "R", persistence="GP", max.iter.EM = 1000, tol1 = 1e-07, 
   hessian = FALSE, hes.method = "simple", REML = FALSE, verbose = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>vam_data</code></td>
<td>

<p>a data frame that contains at least a column "y" containing the student scores, a 
column "student" containing unique student ID's, a column "teacher" containing the 
teacher ID's, and a column "year" which contains the year (or semester, etc.) of the time period. The "y" and "year" variables needs to be numeric. If other variables are to be included 
as fixed effects, they should also be included in vam_data. See 'Note' for further discussion.

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The design for the random teacher effects according to the generalized persistence model
of Mariano et al. (2010) is built into the function. The model includes correlated current- and
future-year effects for each teacher. By setting <code>student.side="R"</code>, the intra-student correlation is 
modeled via an unstructured, block-diagonal error covariance matrix, as specified by Mariano et al. (2010). Setting 
<code>student.side="G"</code> keeps the same teacher structure, but models intra-student correlation via 
random student effects. This is similar to the model used by McCaffrey and Lockwood (2011), and is appropriate when the testing 
scale is the same across years. In this case, the error covariance matrix is diagonal, although a separate variance is calculated for each year.
From a computational perspective, the model estimating the R-side student effects has better scalability properties, although the G-side function is faster (Karl et al. 2012).
</p>
<p>The <code>persistence</code> option determines the type of persistence effects that are modeled. The generalized persistence model ("GP") is described above. When <code>student.side="R"</code>, other models for teacher persistence are available. The reduced GP model  ("rGP", Karl et al. 2012) combines each teacher's future year effects from the GP model into a single effect. The variable persistence model ("VP") assumes that teacher effects in future years are multiples of their effect in the current year (Lockwood et al. 2007). The multipliers in the VP model are called persistence parameters, and are estimated. By contrast, the complete ("CP") and zero ("ZP") persistence models fix the persistence parameters at 1 and 0, respectively (Lockwood et al. 2007). 
</p>
<p>Convergence is declared when <code class="reqn">(l_k-l_{k-1})/l_k &lt; 1E-07</code>, where <code class="reqn">l_k</code> is the log-likelihood 
at iteration <code class="reqn">k</code>.
</p>
<p>The model is estimated via an EM algorithm. For details, see Karl et al. (2012). The model was estimated through Bayesian computation in Mariano et al. (2010).
</p>
<p>Note: When student.side="R" is selected, the first few iterations of the EM algorithm will take longer than subsequent iterations. This is a result of the hybrid gradient-ascent/Newton-Raphson method used in the M-step for the R matrix in the first two iterations (Karl et al. 2012).
</p>
<p><b>Program run time and memory requirements:</b>
The data file GPvam.benchmark that is included with the package contains runtime and peak memory requirements for different persistence settings, using simulated data sets with different values for number of years, number of teachers per year, and number of students per teacher. These have been multiplied to show the total number of teachers in the data set, as well as the total number of students. With student.side="R", the persistence="GP" model is most sensitive to increases in the size of the data set. With student.side="G", the memory requirements increase exponentially with the number of students and teachers, and that model should not be considered scalable to extremely large data sets.
</p>
<p>All of these benchmarks were performed with Hessian=TRUE. Calculation of the Hessian accounts for anywhere from 20% to 75% of those run times. Unless the standard errors of the variance components are needed, leaving Hessian=FALSE will lead to a faster run time with smaller memory requirements.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>GPvam returns an object of class <code>GPvam</code>
</p>
<p>An object of class <code>GPvam</code> is a list containing the following components:
</p>
<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">

</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>Hessian</code></td>
<td>
<p>if requested, the Hessian of the variance parameters</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>R_i</code></td>

<p>(only when <code>student_side</code> is set to 'R') a matrix containing the error covariance matrix of a student</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>teach.cov</code></td>
<td>
<p>a list containing the unique blocks of the covariance matrix of teacher effects</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">

</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>sresid</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector of the scaled conditional residuals</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>yhat</code></td>
<td>
<p>a vector of the predicted values</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>The function  <code>summary</code> provides a summary of the results. This includes the estimated model parameters and standard errors, along with the correlation matrices corresponding to the estimated correlation matrices. Summary information about scaled and raw residuals is reported.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The model assumes that each teacher teaches only one year. If, for example, a teacher teaches in years 1 and 2, his/her first year performance is modeled independently of the second year performance.
To keep these effects separate, the progam appends "(year i)" to each teacher name, where i is the year in which the teacher taught.
</p>
<p>The <code>fixed_effects</code> argument of <code>GPvam</code> utilizes the functionality of R's <code>formula</code> class. In the statement <code>fixed_effects=formula(~as.factor(year)+cont_var+0))</code>, <code>as.factor(year)</code> identifies <code>year</code> as a categorical variable. <code>+0</code> indicates that no intercept is to be fitted, and <code>+cont_var</code> indicates that a seperate effect is to be fitted for the continuous variable "cont_var." An interaction between "year" and "cont_var" could be specified by <code>~as.factor(year)*cont_var+0</code>, or equivalently, <code>~as.factor(year)+cont_var+as.factor(year):cont_var+0</code>. See <code>formula</code> for more details.
</p>
<p>When applied to an object of class GPvam, <code>plot.GPvam</code> returns a caterpillar plot for each effect, as well as residual plots.
