<h2>Example growth curve data in wide format</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A dataset containing example growth of 96 wells of simulated bacteria
or bacteria and phages
</p>
<p>Wells A1...A8 through F1...F8 contain 48 different
simulated bacterial strains growing alone. Wells G1...G8 through L1...L8
contain the same 48 bacterial strains in an identical layout, but this
time growing in the presence of a phage
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">example_widedata_noiseless
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A dataframe with 97 rows and 97 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>time</dt>
<dd>
<p>time, in seconds, since growth curve began</p>
</dd>
<dt>A1, A2...H11, H12</dt>
<dd>
<p>bacterial density in the given well</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Bacterial populations exhibit diauxic growth as they approach their
carrying capacity, and they also evolve resistance in the face of 
selection from the phage population.
</p>
<p>This data does not include any simulated noise
