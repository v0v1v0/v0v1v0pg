<h2>targets: Dynamic Function-Oriented Make-Like Declarative Pipelines for R</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In computationally demanding data analysis pipelines,
the <code>targets</code> R package maintains an up-to-date set of results
while skipping tasks that do not need to rerun. This process
increases speed and increases trust in the final end product.
However, it also overwrites old output with new output,
and past results disappear by default. To preserve historical output,
the <code>gittargets</code> package captures version-controlled snapshots
of the data store, and each snapshot links to the underlying
commit of the source code. That way, when the user rolls back
the code to a previous branch or commit, <code>gittargets</code> can recover
the data contemporaneous with that commit so that all targets
remain up to date.
