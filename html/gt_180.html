<h2>Get a themed font stack that works well across systems</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A font stack can be obtained from <code>system_fonts()</code> using one of various
keywords such as <code>"system-ui"</code>, <code>"old-style"</code>, and <code>"humanist"</code> (there are 15
in total) representing a themed set of fonts. These sets comprise a font
family that has been tested to work across a wide range of computer systems.
This is useful when specifying <code>font</code> values in <code>cell_text()</code>
(itself used inside <code>tab_style()</code>). If using <code>opt_table_font()</code>, we can
invoke this function in its <code>stack</code> argument.

<h3>The font stacks and the individual fonts used by platform</h3>



<h4>System UI (<code>"system-ui"</code>)</h4>

<div class="sourceCode css"><pre>font-family: system-ui, sans-serif;
</pre></div>
<p>The operating system interface's default typefaces are known as system UI
fonts. They contain a variety of font weights, are quite readable at small
sizes, and are perfect for UI elements. These typefaces serve as a great
starting point for text in data tables and so this font stack is the default
for <strong>gt</strong>.
</p>



<h4>Transitional (<code>"transitional"</code>)</h4>

<div class="sourceCode css"><pre>font-family: Charter, 'Bitstream Charter', 'Sitka Text', Cambria, serif;
</pre></div>
<p>The Enlightenment saw the development of transitional typefaces, which
combine Old Style and Modern typefaces. <em>Times New Roman</em>, a transitional
typeface created for the Times of London newspaper, is among the most
well-known instances of this style.
</p>



<h4>Old Style (<code>"old-style"</code>)</h4>

<div class="sourceCode css"><pre>font-family: 'Iowan Old Style', 'Palatino Linotype', 'URW Palladio L', P052, serif;
</pre></div>
<p>Old style typefaces were created during the Renaissance and are distinguished
by diagonal stress, a lack of contrast between thick and thin strokes, and
rounded serifs. <em>Garamond</em> is among the most well-known instances of an antique
typeface.
</p>



<h4>Humanist (<code>"humanist"</code>)</h4>

<div class="sourceCode css"><pre>font-family: Seravek, 'Gill Sans Nova', Ubuntu, Calibri, 'DejaVu Sans', source-sans-pro, sans-serif;
</pre></div>
<p>Low contrast between thick and thin strokes and organic, calligraphic forms
are traits of humanist typefaces. These typefaces, which draw their
inspiration from Renaissance calligraphy, are frequently regarded as being
more readable and easier to read than other sans serif typefaces.
</p>



<h4>Geometric Humanist (<code>"geometric-humanist"</code>)</h4>

<div class="sourceCode css"><pre>font-family: Avenir, Montserrat, Corbel, 'URW Gothic', source-sans-pro, sans-serif;
</pre></div>
<p>Clean, geometric forms and consistent stroke widths are characteristics of
geometric humanist typefaces. These typefaces, which are frequently used for
headlines and other display purposes, are frequently thought to be
contemporary and slick in appearance. A well-known example of this
classification is <em>Futura</em>.
</p>



<h4>Classical Humanist (<code>"classical-humanist"</code>)</h4>

<div class="sourceCode css"><pre>font-family: Optima, Candara, 'Noto Sans', source-sans-pro, sans-serif;
</pre></div>
<p>The way the strokes gradually widen as they approach the stroke terminals
without ending in a serif is what distinguishes classical humanist typefaces.
The stone carving on Renaissance-era tombstones and classical Roman capitals
served as inspiration for these typefaces.
</p>



<h4>Neo-Grotesque (<code>"neo-grotesque"</code>)</h4>

<div class="sourceCode css"><pre>font-family: Inter, Roboto, 'Helvetica Neue', 'Arial Nova', 'Nimbus Sans', Arial, sans-serif;
</pre></div>
<p>Neo-grotesque typefaces are a form of sans serif that originated in the late
19th and early 20th centuries. They are distinguished by their crisp,
geometric shapes and regular stroke widths. <em>Helvetica</em> is among the most
well-known examples of a Neo-grotesque typeface.
</p>



<h4>Monospace Slab Serif (<code>"monospace-slab-serif"</code>)</h4>

<div class="sourceCode css"><pre>font-family: 'Nimbus Mono PS', 'Courier New', monospace;
</pre></div>
<p>Monospace slab serif typefaces are distinguished by their fixed-width
letters, which are the same width irrespective of their shape, and their
straightforward, geometric forms. For reports, tabular work, and technical
documentation, this technique is used to simulate typewriter output.
</p>



<h4>Monospace Code (<code>"monospace-code"</code>)</h4>

<div class="sourceCode css"><pre>font-family: ui-monospace, 'Cascadia Code', 'Source Code Pro', Menlo, Consolas, 'DejaVu Sans Mono', monospace;
</pre></div>
<p>Specifically created for use in programming and other technical applications,
monospace code typefaces are used in these fields. These typefaces are
distinguished by their clear, readable forms and monospaced design, which
ensures that all letters and characters are the same width.
</p>



<h4>Industrial (<code>"industrial"</code>)</h4>

<div class="sourceCode css"><pre>font-family: Bahnschrift, 'DIN Alternate', 'Franklin Gothic Medium', 'Nimbus Sans Narrow', sans-serif-condensed, sans-serif;
</pre></div>
<p>The development of industrial typefaces began in the late 19th century and
was greatly influenced by the industrial and technological advancements of
the time. Industrial typefaces are distinguished by their strong sans serif
letterforms, straightforward appearance, and use of geometric shapes and
straight lines.
</p>



<h4>Rounded Sans (<code>"rounded-sans"</code>)</h4>

<div class="sourceCode css"><pre>font-family: ui-rounded, 'Hiragino Maru Gothic ProN', Quicksand, Comfortaa, Manjari, 'Arial Rounded MT', 'Arial Rounded MT Bold', Calibri, source-sans-pro, sans-serif;
</pre></div>
<p>The rounded, curved letterforms that define rounded typefaces give them a
softer, friendlier appearance. The typeface's rounded edges give it a more
natural and playful feel, making it appropriate for use in casual or
kid-friendly designs. Since the 1950s, the rounded sans-serif design has
gained popularity and is still frequently used in branding, graphic design,
and other fields.
</p>



<h4>Slab Serif (<code>"slab-serif"</code>)</h4>

<div class="sourceCode css"><pre>font-family: Rockwell, 'Rockwell Nova', 'Roboto Slab', 'DejaVu Serif', 'Sitka Small', serif;
</pre></div>
<p>Slab Serif typefaces are distinguished by the thick, block-like serifs that
appear at the ends of each letterform. Typically, these serifs are
unbracketed, which means that they do not have any curved or tapered
transitions to the letter's main stroke.
</p>



<h4>Antique (<code>"antique"</code>)</h4>

<div class="sourceCode css"><pre>font-family: Superclarendon, 'Bookman Old Style', 'URW Bookman', 'URW Bookman L', 'Georgia Pro', Georgia, serif;
</pre></div>
<p>Serif typefaces that were popular in the 19th century include antique
typefaces, also referred to as Egyptians. They are distinguished by their
thick, uniform stroke weight and block-like serifs.
</p>



<h4>Didone (<code>"didone"</code>)</h4>

<div class="sourceCode css"><pre>font-family: Didot, 'Bodoni MT', 'Noto Serif Display', 'URW Palladio L', P052, Sylfaen, serif;
</pre></div>
<p>Didone typefaces, also referred to as Modern typefaces, are distinguished by
their vertical stress, sharp contrast between thick and thin strokes, and
hairline serifs without bracketing. The Didone style first appeared in the
late 18th century and became well-known in the early 19th century.
</p>



<h4>Handwritten (<code>"handwritten"</code>)</h4>

<div class="sourceCode css"><pre>font-family: 'Segoe Print', 'Bradley Hand', Chilanka, TSCu_Comic, casual, cursive;
</pre></div>
<p>The appearance and feel of handwriting are replicated by handwritten
typefaces. Although there are a wide variety of handwriting styles, this font
stack tends to use a more casual and commonplace style.
</p>



<h3>Examples</h3>

<p>Use a subset of the <code>sp500</code> dataset to create a <strong>gt</strong> table with 10 rows.
For the <code>date</code> column and the column labels, let's use a different font stack
(the <code>"industrial"</code> one). The system fonts used in this particular stack are
<code>"Bahnschrift"</code>, <code>"DIN Alternate"</code>, <code>"Franklin Gothic Medium"</code>, and
<code>"Nimbus Sans Narrow"</code> (the generic <code>"sans-serif-condensed"</code> and <code>"sans-serif"</code>
are used if the aforementioned fonts aren't available).
</p>
<div class="sourceCode r"><pre>sp500 |&gt;
  dplyr::slice(1:10) |&gt;
  dplyr::select(-volume, -adj_close) |&gt;
  gt() |&gt;
  fmt_currency() |&gt;
  tab_style(
    style = cell_text(
      font = system_fonts(name = "industrial"),
      size = px(18)
    ),
    locations = list(
      cells_body(columns = date),
      cells_column_labels()
    )
  )
</pre></div>
