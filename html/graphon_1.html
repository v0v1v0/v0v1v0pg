<h2>graphon : A Collection of Graphon Estimation Methods</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The <span class="pkg">graphon</span> provides a not-so-comprehensive list of methods for estimating graphon,
a symmetric measurable function, from a single or multiple of observed networks.
It also contains several auxiliary functions for generating sample networks using
various network models and graphons.
</p>


<h3>What is Graphon?</h3>

<p>Graphon - graph function - is a symmetric measurable function </p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><code class="reqn">W:[0,1]^2\rightarrow[0,1]</code>
</p>
<p> that arise
in studying exchangeable random graph models as well as sequence of dense graphs. In the language of
graph theory, it can be understood as a two-stage procedural network modeling that 1) each vertex/node in the graph
is assigned an independent random variable <code class="reqn">u_j</code> from uniform distribution <code class="reqn">U[0,1]</code>, and
2) each edge <code class="reqn">(i,j)</code> is randomly determined with probability <code class="reqn">W(u_i,u_j)</code>. Due to such
procedural aspect, the term <em>probability matrix</em> and <em>graphon</em> will be interchangeably used
in further documentation.
</p>


<h3>Composition of the package</h3>

<p>The package mainly consists of two types of functions whose names start with <code>'est'</code>
and <code>'gmodel'</code> for estimation algorithms and graph models, respectively.
</p>
<p>The <code>'est'</code> family has 4 estimation methods at the current version,
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>est.LG</code> for empirical degree sorting in stochastic blockmodel.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>est.SBA</code> for stochastic blockmodel approximation.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>est.USVT</code> for universal singular value thresholding.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>est.nbdsmooth</code> for neighborhood smoothing.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>est.completion</code> for matrix completion from a partially revealed data.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Also, the current release has following graph models implemented,
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>gmodel.P</code> generates a binary graph given an arbitrary probability matrix.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>gmodel.ER</code> is an implementation of Erdos-Renyi random graph models.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>gmodel.block</code> is used to generate networks with block structure.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>gmodel.preset</code> has 10 exemplary graphon models for simulation.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
