<h2>Matched data from two groups where ratio between them is consistent.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>An example dataset for paired ratio Student's <em>t</em> test. These are Cytokine measurements by ELISA (in ng/ml) from 33 independent in vitro experiments performed on two Genotypes that we want to compare. The data are in a longtable format, and the two groups are levels within the factor "Genotype". The Experiment column lists ID of matched experiments.
