<h2>Kernel causality summary of evidence for causal paths from three criteria</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>While allowing the researcher to keep some variables as controls,
or outside the scope of causal path determination 
(e.g., age or latitude)  this function produces detailed causal path information 
in a 5 column matrix identifying the names of variables,
causal path directions, path strengths re-scaled to be in the 
range [–100, 100], (table reports absolute values of the strength)
plus Pearson correlation and its p-value.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">causeSummary(
  mtx,
  nam = colnames(mtx),
  ctrl = 0,
  dig = 6,
  wt = c(1.2, 1.1, 1.05, 1),
  sumwt = 4
)
</code></pre>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The algorithm determines causal path directions from the sign
of the strength index and strength index values by comparing 
three aspects of flipped kernel regressions: 
[x1 on (x2, x3, .. xp)] and its flipped version [x2 on (x1, x3, .. xp)]
We compare (i) formal exogeneity test criterion, (ii) absolute residuals, and
(iii) R-squares of the flipped regressions implying three criteria Cr1, to Cr3.
The criteria are quantified by sophisticated methods using four orders
of stochastic dominance, SD1 to SD4. We assume slightly declining weights on 
causal path signs because known reliability ranking. SD1 is better than SD2,
better than SD3, better than SD4. The user can optionally change our weights.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>If there are p columns in the input matrix, x1, x2, .., xp, say,
and if we keep x1 as a common member of all causal direction pairs
(x1, x(1+j)) for (j=1, 2, .., p-1) which can be flipped. That is, either x1 is
the cause or x(1+j) is the cause in a chosen pair.
The control
variables are not flipped. The printed output of this function
reports the results for p-1 pairs indicating which variable
(by name) causes which another variable (also by name).
It also prints a signed summary strength index in the range [-100,100]. 
A positive sign of the strength index means x1 kernel causes x(1+j),
whereas negative strength index means x(1+j) kernel causes x1. The function 
also prints Pearson correlation and its p-value. In short, function returns
a matrix of p-1 rows and 5 columns entitled: 
“cause", “response", “strength", “corr." and “p-value", respectively
with self-explanatory titles. The first two columns have names of variables
x1 or x(1+j), depending on which is the cause. The ‘strength’ column
reports the absolute value of summary index, now in the range [0,100]  
providing summary of causal results
based on preponderance of evidence from Cr1 to Cr3 
from four orders of stochastic dominance, etc.  The order of input columns matters.
The fourth column ‘corr.’ reports the Pearson correlation coefficient while
the fifth column has the p-value for testing the null of zero Pearson coeff.
This function calls  <code>silentPairs</code> allowing for control variables.
The output of this function can be sent to ‘xtable’ for a nice Latex table.

<h3>Note</h3>

<p>The European Crime data has all three criteria correctly suggesting that
high crime rate kernel causes the deployment of a large number of police officers.
Since Cr1 to Cr3 near unanimously suggest ‘crim’ as the cause of ‘off’, 
strength index 100 suggests unanimity. In portfolio
applications of stochastic dominance one wants higher returns.  Here we are
comparing two probability distributions of absolute residuals for two
flipped models. We choose that flip which has smaller absolute residuals
or better fit.
