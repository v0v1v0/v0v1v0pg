<h2>Segregating overlapping ranges</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>One-dimensional ranged data in the x-direction is segregated in
the y-direction such that no overlap in two-dimensional space occurs. This
positioning works best when no relevant information is plotted in the
y-direction.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">position_disjoint_ranges(extend = 1, stepsize = 1)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>extend</code></td>
<td>
<p>a <code>numeric</code> of length 1 indicating how far a range should
be extended in total for calculating overlaps. Setting this argument to a
positive number leaves some space between ranges in the same bin.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>stepsize</code></td>
<td>
<p>a <code>numeric</code> of length 1 that determines how much space
is added between bins in the y-direction. A positive value grows the bins
from bottom to top, while a negative value grows the bins from top to
bottom.</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>An object is considered disjoint from a second object when the range
between their <code>xmin</code> and <code>xmax</code> coordinates don't overlap.
Objects that overlap are assigned to different bins in the y-direction,
whereby lower bins are filled first. This way, information in the
x-direction is preserved and different objects can be discerned.
</p>
<p>Note that this positioning is only particularly useful when y-coordinates
do not encode relevant information. Geoms that pair well with this
positioning are <code>geom_rect()</code> and
<code>ggplot2::geom_tile()</code>.
</p>
<p>This positioning function was inspired by the <code>disjointBins()</code>
function in the <code>IRanges</code> package, but has been written such that it
accepts any numeric input next to solely integer input.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <em>PositionDisjointRanges</em> object.
</p>


<h3>See Also</h3>

<p>The <code>disjointBins</code> function the Bioconductor IRanges package.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R"># Even though geom_tile() is parametrised by middle-x values, it is
# internally converted to xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax parametrisation so the
# positioning still works.

ggplot() +
  geom_tile(aes(x = rnorm(200), y = 0),
            width = 0.2, height = 0.9,
            position = position_disjoint_ranges(extend = 0.1))
</code></pre>
