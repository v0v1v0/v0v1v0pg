<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Gather the preprocess data from a formula and a model,
where the output corresponds to the data structure used by the engine
<code>gather_compute</code>; see <code>estimate()</code>.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">GatherPreprocessing(
  formula,
  model = c("DyNAM", "REM"),
  subModel = c("choice", "choice_coordination", "rate"),

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>It differs from the <code>estimate()</code> output when the argument <code>preprocessingOnly</code>
is set to <code>TRUE</code> regarding the memory space requirement.
The <code>gatherPreprocessing()</code> produces a list where the first element
is a matrix that could have up to the number of events times
the number of actors rows and the number of effects columns.
For medium to large datasets with thousands of events and
thousands of actors, the memory RAM requirements are large and,
therefore, errors are produced due to a lack of space.
The advantage of the data structure is that it can be adapted
to estimate the models (or extensions of them) using standard packages
for generalized linear models (or any other model)
that use tabular data as input.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>a list object including:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>stat_all_events</dt>
<dd>
<p>a matrix. The number of rows can be up to the number
of events times the number of actors
(square number of actors for the REM).
Rigth-censored events are included when the model has an intercept.
The number of columns is the number of effects in the model.
Every row is the effect statistics at the time of the event for each actor
in the choice set or the sender set.</p>
</dd>
<dt>n_candidates</dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector with the number of rows related with an event.
The length correspond to the number of events
plus right censored events if any.</p>
</dd>
<dt>selected</dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector with the position of the
selected actor (choice model), sender actor (rate model), or
active dyad (choice-coordination model, REM model).
Indexing start at 1 for each event.</p>
</dd>
<dt>sender, receiver</dt>
<dd>
<p>a character vector with the label of the sender/receiver actor.
For right-censored events the receiver values is not meaningful.</p>
</dd>
<dt>hasIntercept</dt>
<dd>
<p>a logical value indicating if the model has an intercept.</p>
</dd>
<dt>namesEffects</dt>
<dd>
<p>a character vector with a short name of the effect.
It includes the name of the object used to calculate the effects and
modifiers of the effect, e.g., the type of effect, weighted effect.</p>
</dd>
<dt>effectDescription</dt>
<dd>
<p>a character matrix with the description of the effects.
It includes the name of the object used to calculate the effects and
additional information of the effect, e.g., the type of effect,
weighted effect, transformation function, window length.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>If the model has an intercept and the subModel is <code>rate</code> or model is <code>REM</code>,
additional elements are included:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>timespan</dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector with the time span between events,
including right-censored events.</p>
</dd>
<dt>isDependent</dt>
<dd>
<p>a logical vector indicating if the event is dependent or right-censored.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
