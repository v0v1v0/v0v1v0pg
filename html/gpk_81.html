<h2>
Fitting probability distribution to life data of Sheeps
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>In biology often it is of interest to describe life span of an organism. Parametric approach to this problem involves fitting a given probability distribution. Common distributions used here are exponential, Weibul and Gamma. Occasionally other distributions such as inverse Gaussian, log-normal distribution etc. are also fitted. 
The data refer to age at death of a species of sheep. Age was estimated using skulls. 
In case of the above data usual distributions failed to give a good fit. There is considerable improvement by using, instead, a quadratic hazard function.

<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(Sheeplife)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 11 observations on the following 2 variables.
</p>

<dl>
<dt><code>Age_at_death</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Age at death (years)</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Frequency</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>Frequency</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Estimate parameters by maximum likelihood and test goodness of fit using chi-square test.
