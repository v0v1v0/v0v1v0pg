<h2>Recover data Stored in a ggghost object</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data used to generate a plot is an essential requirement for a 
reproducible graphic. This is somewhat available from a ggplot <code>grob</code> 
(in raw form) but it it not easily accessible, and isn't named the same way 
as the original call.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">recover_data(x, supp = TRUE)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>A ggghost object from which to extract the data.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>supp</code></td>
<td>
<p>(logical) Should the supplementary data be extracted also?</p>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3>Details</h3>

<p>This function retrieves the data from the ggghost object as it was when it 
was originally called.
</p>
<p>If supplementary data has also been attached using <code>supp_data</code> 
then this will also be recovered (if requested).
</p>
<p>When used iteractively, a warning will be produced if the data to be
extracted exists in the workspace but not identical to the captured version.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A <code>data.frame</code> of the original data, named as it was when used 
in <code>ggplot(data)</code>
</p>
