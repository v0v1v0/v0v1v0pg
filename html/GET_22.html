<h2>GDP</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Gross domestic product (GDP)
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data("GDP")
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A <code>curve_set</code> object containing the GDP values for different countries.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data here was constructed based on the following data:
The GDP data are publicly available at
<a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD">https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.PCAP.CD</a>.
The excel file that we downloaded was called
<code>API_NY.GDP.PCAP.CD_DS2_en_excel_v2_3358980.xls</code>.
The inflation rates are publicly available at
<a href="https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.DEFL.KD.ZG">https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/NY.GDP.DEFL.KD.ZG</a>.
The excel file that we downloaded was called
<code>API_NY.GDP.DEFL.KD.ZG_DS2_en_excel_v2_3469555.xls</code>,
from there we took only the inflation rates for United States.
Both are distributed under the CC-BY 4.0 license (see
https://datacatalog.worldbank.org/public-licenses#cc-by).
</p>
<p>Then we discounted the GDP of every country in the study to the 1960 USD,
and we extrapolated the missing values of the GDP of a country using the
closest known ratio of the GDP of the country and the median GDP in that year.
Further, the missing values of GDP were interpolated using linear
interpolation of the two closest ratios. Appendix of the
<code>vignette(FDRenvelopes)</code> includes the code to prepare the
<code>curve_set</code> object.
