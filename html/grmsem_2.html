<h2>Symmetric GRM data: small data set</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A genetic relationship matrix for a small tri-variate data set was simulated assuming an underlying 
Cholesky model, with 100 observations per trait and low polygenicity (150 SNPs per genetic factor).
Genetic trait variances were set to 0.30, 0.60, 0.60 and 0.70 respectively, and residual variances
to 0.70, 0.40, 0.40 and 0.30. The data set is described in full, including genetic and residual
covariances, in the vignette. The traits are influenced by three independent genetic factors 
(A1, A2 and A3, based on a 150 SNPs each) and three independent residual factors (E1, E2 and E3).
