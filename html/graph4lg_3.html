<h2>Compare two correlation coefficients obtained from different sample sizes</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The function compares two correlation coefficients obtained from
different sample sizes using Z-Fisher transformation.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">compar_r_fisher(data)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table><tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>
<p>An object of class <code>data.frame</code> with at least 4 columns
of data used to perform the test.
4 columns must be called "n1", "n2", "r1" and "r2".
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>n1 and n2 are the sizes of the samples from which r1 and r2
were computed respectively.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>r1 and r2 are Pearson's correlation coefficients
</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The Z-Fisher method consists in computing z scores from the
correlation coefficients and to compare these z scores.
z scores are computed as follows :
Let n1 and r1 be the sample size and the correlation coefficient,
z1 = (1/2)*log( (1+r1) / (1-r1) )
Then, a test's statistic is computed from z1 and z2 :
Z = (z1-z2) / sqrt( (1/(n1-3)) + (1/(n2-3)))
If Z is above the limit given by the alpha value, then the difference between
r1 and r2 is significant
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An object of class <code>data.frame</code> with the same columns as 'data'
and 4 columns more : z1, z2 (respective z-scores), Z (test's statistic) and
p (p-value) of the test.
