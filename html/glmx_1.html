<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data were prepared and analyzed by Alvarez and Brehm (1995). A detailed
discussion of the variables is provided in their Appendix A and the model
is developed in their Section 3.
</p>
<p>The data were reanalyzed by Altman and McDonald (2003) with focus on numerical
accuracy and by Keele and Park (2006) with focus on interpretability.
