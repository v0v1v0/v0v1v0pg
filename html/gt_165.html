<h2>Apply conditional formatting to cells with <code>rows</code> and <code>columns</code>
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>To apply styling or formatting, you can use the
<code>columns</code> and <code>rows</code> arguments. The syntax should be very familiar for dplyr
users as you can use the tidyselect specification.
</p>
<p>Targeting of values is done through <code>columns</code> and additionally by <code>rows</code> (if
nothing is provided for <code>rows</code> then entire columns are selected). The
<code>columns</code> argument allows us to target a subset of cells contained in the
resolved columns. We say resolved because aside from declaring column names
in <code>c()</code> (with bare column names or names in quotes) we can use
<strong>tidyselect</strong>-style expressions. This can be as basic as supplying a select
helper like <code>starts_with()</code>, or, providing a more complex incantation like
</p>
<p><code>where(~ is.numeric(.x) &amp; max(.x, na.rm = TRUE) &gt; 1E6)</code>
</p>
<p>which targets numeric columns that have a maximum value greater than
1,000,000 (excluding any <code>NA</code>s from consideration).
</p>
<p>By default all columns and rows are selected (with the <code>everything()</code>
defaults). Cell values that are incompatible with a given formatting function
will be skipped over, like <code>character</code> values and numeric <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠fmt_*()⁠</code>
functions. So it's safe to select all columns with a particular formatting
function (only those values that can be formatted will be formatted), but,
you may not want that. One strategy is to format the bulk of cell values with
one formatting function and then constrain the columns for later passes with
other types of formatting (the last formatting done to a cell is what you get
in the final output).
</p>
<p>Once the columns are targeted, we may also target the <code>rows</code> within those
columns. This can be done in a variety of ways. If a stub is present, then we
potentially have row identifiers. Those can be used much like column names in
the <code>columns</code>-targeting scenario. We can use simpler <strong>tidyselect</strong>-style
expressions (the select helpers should work well here) and we can use quoted
row identifiers in <code>c()</code>. It's also possible to use row indices (e.g.,
<code>c(3, 5, 6)</code>) though these index values must correspond to the row numbers of
the input data (the indices won't necessarily match those of rearranged rows
if row groups are present). One more type of expression is possible, an
expression that takes column values (can involve any of the available columns
in the table) and returns a logical vector. This is nice if you want to base
formatting on values in the column or another column, or, you'd like to use a
more complex predicate expression.

<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">gt_tbl &lt;- gt(exibble)
gt_tbl %&gt;%
  fmt_time(
    columns = contains("time") &amp; !starts_with("date"),
     rows = num &gt; 100 &amp; group == "grp_b"
  )

# Styling numeric columns based on range

gt_tbl %&gt;% tab_style(
  style = cell_text(weight = "bold"),
  locations = cells_body(
  columns =  where(is.factor)
  )
)

# Naming rows

gt_tbl_rows &lt;- gt(exibble, rowname_col = "row")
gt_tbl_rows %&gt;%
  fmt_datetime(
    columns = datetime,
    rows = c("row_1", "row_8")
  )
</code></pre>
