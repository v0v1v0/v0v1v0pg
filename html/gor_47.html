<h2>Ant colony optimization algorithm for the TSP</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Ant colony optimization (ACO) heuristic algorithm to search for a
low-distance tour of a TSP instance.  ACO is a random
algorithm; as such, it yields better results when longer
searches are run.  To guess the adequate parameter values
resulting in better performance in particular instances
requires some experimentation, since no universal values of
the parameters seem to be appropriate to all examples.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">search_tour_ants(
  d,
  n,
  K = 200,
  N = 50,
  beta = 3,
  alpha = 5,
  dt = 1,
  rho = 0.05,
  log = FALSE
)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>d</code></td>
<td>
<p>Distance matrix of the TSP instance.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>n</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of vertices of the complete TSP graph.  It can be
less than the number of rows of the distance matrix d.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>K</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of tour-searching ants.  Defaults to 200.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>N</code></td>
<td>
<p>Number of iterations.  Defaults to 50.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>beta</code></td>
<td>
<p>Inverse temperature which determines the thermal
probability in selecting the next vertex in tour.  High beta
(low temperature) rewards lower distances (and thus it gets
stuck sooner in local minima), while low beta (high
temperature) rewards longer tours, thus escaping from local
minima.  Defaults to 3.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>alpha</code></td>
<td>
<p>Exponent enhancing the pheromone trail.  High alpha
means a clearer trail, low alpha means more options.  It
defaults to 5.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>dt</code></td>
<td>
<p>Basic pheromone enhancement at each iteration.  It
defaults to 1.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>rho</code></td>
<td>
<p>Parameter in the (0,1) interval controlling pheromone
evaporation rate.  Pheromones of the chosen tour increase in
dt*rho, while excluded pheromones diminish in 1-rho.  A rho
value near 1 means select just one tour, while lower values of
rho spread the probability and more tours can be explored.  It
defaults to 0.05.</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>log</code></td>
<td>
<p>Boolean.  When TRUE, it also outputs two vectos
recording the performance of the algorithm.  It defaults to FALSE.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>ACO is an optimization paradigm that tries to replicate the
behavior of a colony of ants when looking for food.  Ants
leave after them a soft pheromone trail to help others follow
the path just in case some food has been found.  Pheromones
evaporate, but following again the trail reinforces it, making
it easier to find and follow.  Thus, a team of ants search a
tour in a TSP instance, leaving a pheromone trail on the edges
of the tour.  At each step, each ant decides the next step
based on the pheromone level and on the distance of each
neighboring edge.  In a single iteration, each ant completes a
tour, and the best tour is recorded.  Then the pheromone level
of the edges of the best tour are enhanced, and the remaining
pheromones evaporate.
</p>
<p>Default parameter values have been chosen in order to find the
optimum in the examples considered below.  However, it cannot
be guarateed that this is the best choice for all cases.  Keep
in mind that no polynomial time exact algorithm can exist for
the TSP, and thus harder instances will require to fine-tune
the parameters.  In any case, no guarantee of optimality of
tours found by this method can be given, so they might be
improved further by other methods.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>A list with two components: $tour contains a permutation
of the 1:n sequence representing the tour constructed by the
algorithm, $distance contains the value of the distance
covered by the tour.  When log=TRUE, the output list contains
also the component $Lant, best tour distance found in the current
iteration, and component $Lopt, best tour distance found
before and including the current iteration.
