<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This package provides convenient software tools for causal path determinations
using Vinod (2014, 2015, 2018, 2021) and is explained in many package vignettes.
<code>causeSummary(mtx)</code>, <code>causeSummary2(mtx)</code>,<code>causeSum2Blk(mtx)</code>,
<code>causeSummBlk</code> are various versions reporting pair-wise causal 
path directions and causal strengths. We fit
a kernel regression of X1 on (X2, X3,..Xk) and another flipped regression
of X2 on (X1, x3, ..Xk).  We compare the two fits using three sophisticated criteria
called Cr1 to Cr3. We rescale the
weighted sum of the quantified three criteria to the [-100, 100] range.
The sign of the weighted sum gives the direction of the causal path, and 
the magnitude of the weighted sum gives the strength of the causal path.
A matrix of non-symmetric generalized correlations r*(x|y) is reported by the
functions <code>rstar()</code> and <code>gmcmtx0()</code>. 
<code>sudoCoefParcor()</code> computes pseudo kernel regression coefficients based on
generalized partial correlation coefficients (GPCC)
<code>depMeas()</code> a measure of nonlinear nonparametric dependence between two vectors.
<code>parcorVec()</code> has generalized partial correlation coefficients, Vinod (2021)
<code>parcorVecH()</code> has a hybrid version of the above (using HGPCC).
The usual partial correlations r(x,y|z) for regression of y on (x, z) measure
the effect of y on x after removing the effect of z, where z can have several variables.
Vinod (2021) suggests new generalized partial correlation coefficients (GPCC)
using kernel regressions, r*(x,y|z).

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The criterion Cr1 uses observable values of standard exogeneity test criterion,
namely, (kernel regression residual) times (regressor values)
Cr2 computes absolute values kernel regression residuals.
The quantification of Cr1 and Cr2 further uses four orders of stochastic 
dominance measures.
Cr3 compares the R-square of the two fits.
The package provides additional tools for matrix algebra, such as 
<code>cofactor()</code>, for outlier detection <code>get0outlier()</code>, 
for numerical integration by the trapezoidal rule, stochastic dominance
<code>stochdom2()</code> and <code>comp_portfo2()</code>, etc.
The package has a function <code>pcause()</code> for bootstrap-based statistical 
inference and another one 
for a heuristic t-test called <code>heurist()</code>.  Pairwise deletion of missing data
is done in <code>napair()</code>, while triplet-wise deletion is in <code>naTriplet()</code>
intended for use when control variable(s) are also present. If one has
panel data, functions <code>PanelLag()</code> and <code>Panel2Lag()</code> are relevant.
<code>pillar3D</code> provides 3-dimensional plots of data that look
more like surfaces, than usual plots with vertical pins.
</p>
<p>Recent 2020 additions include <code>canonRho()</code> for generalized canonical 
correlations, and many 
functions for Granger causality between lagged time series including
<code>GcRsqX12()</code>, <code>bootGcRsq()</code> and <code>GcRsqYXc()</code>.
</p>
<p>Recent additions include several functions for portfolio choice.
<code>causeSum2Panel()</code> for panel data, 
<code>sudoCoefParcor()</code> for pseudo regression coefficients for kernel regressions.
<code>decileVote()</code>, <code>momentVote()</code>, <code>exactSdMtx()</code> for exact
computation of stochastic dominance from ECDF areas. The newer stochastic
dominance tools are used in <code>causeSummary2(mtx)</code>,<code>causeSum2Blk(mtx)</code>
<code>dif4mtx()</code>
computes growth, change in growth etc. up-to order 4 differencing of time series.
<code>outOFsamp()</code> and <code>outOFsell()</code> pandemic-proof 
out-of-sample evaluation of portfolio returns using randomization.
<code>causeSum2Panel()</code> exploits panel data features for causal paths.
