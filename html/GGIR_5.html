Calculates Sleep Regularity Index
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculates Sleep Regularity Index per day pair proposed by Phillips and 
colleagues in 2017 expanded with day-pair level estimates.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">  CalcSleepRegularityIndex(data = c(), epochsize = c(), desiredtz= c())
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>data</code></td>
<td>

<p>Data.frame produced by function g.sib.det.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>epochsize</code></td>
<td>

<p>Numeric value of epoch size in seconds.
</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>desiredtz</code></td>
<td>

<p>Character with timezone database name, see also g.getmeta
</p>
</td>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Calculates Sleep Regularity Index per day pair. Absense of missing data is not used 
as a criteria for calculation. Instead the code asses the fraction of the time for which
matching valid data points were found in both days. Later in g.part4 this fraction is used
to include or exclude days based on the excludenightcrit criteria it also uses for the other
sleep variables. In g.report.part4 these day-level SRI values are stored, but also
aggregated across all recording days, all weekend days, and all weekend days, respectively. 
Therefore, this function is broader in functionality than the algorithm proposed by Phillips and 
colleagues in 2017.

<h3>Value</h3>

<p>Data.frame with columns: day (day number); Sleep Regularity Index, which by definition must lie in the 
range -100 (reversed regularity), to 0 (random pattern), to 100 (perfect regularity);
weekday (e.g. Wednesday); frac_valid, number between 0 and 1 indicating the fraction of the 24 hour
period for which valid data was available in both the current and the next day, and; date.
