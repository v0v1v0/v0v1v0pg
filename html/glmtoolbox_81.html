<h2>Alaska pipeline</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The Alaska pipeline data consists of in-field ultrasonic
measurements of defects depths in the Alaska pipeline. The depth of
the defects was measured again in the laboratory. These measurements
were performed in six batches. The data were analyzed to calibrate
the bias of field measurements relative to laboratory measurements.
In this analysis, the field measurement is the response variable and
the laboratory measurement is the predictor variable.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(pipeline)
</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<p>A data frame with 107 rows and 2 variables:
</p>

<dl>
<dt>Field</dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector indicating the number of defects measured in the field.</p>
</dd>
<dt>Lab</dt>
<dd>
<p>a numeric vector indicating the number of defects measured in the laboratory.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
