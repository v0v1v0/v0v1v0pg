<h2>Distance gain when transposing two cities in a tour</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Distance gain when two cities in a TSP tour are interchanged, that
is, the neighbors of the first become the neighbors of the
second and vice versa.  It is used to detect favorable moves
in a Lin-Kernighan-based routine for the TSP.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">compute_gain_transp(C, tr, d)
</code></pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>C</code></td>
<td>
<p>Tour represented as a non-repeated vertex sequence.
Equivalently, a permutation of the sequence from 1 to length(C).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>tr</code></td>
<td>
<p>Transposition, represented as a pair of indices between
1 and length(C).</p>
</td>
</tr>
<tr style="vertical-align: top;">
<td><code>d</code></td>
<td>
<p>Distance matrix.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>It computes the gain in distance when interchanging two cities in
a tour.  The transformation is akin to a 2-interchange; in
fact, if the transposed vertices are neighbors in the tour or
share a common neighbor, the transposition is a
2-interchange.  If the transposed vertices in the tour do not
share any neighbors, then the transposition is a pair of
2-interchanges.
</p>
<p>This gain is used in improve_tour_LinKer, where the
transposition neighborhood is used instead of the variable
k-opt neighborhood for simplicity.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The gain in distance after performing transposition tr in
tour C with distance matrix d.
