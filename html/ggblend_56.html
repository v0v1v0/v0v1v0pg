<h2>Layer operation composition</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>operations can be composed together to form chains of operations, which
when multiplied by (applied to) layer-like objects, return modified layer-like objects. In
contrast to operation_products, compositions of operations are not
distributive over sums of operations or layer-like objects.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Operation composition is achieved through function application, typically
using the pipe operator (<code style="white-space: pre;">⁠|&gt;⁠</code>); e.g. <code style="white-space: pre;">⁠operation1 |&gt; operation2⁠</code>.
</p>
<p>The output of composing <span class="pkg">ggblend</span> operations depends on the types of
objects being composed:
</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p> If you compose an operation with an operation, they are merged into
a single operation that applies each operation in sequence, without
distributing over layers.
</p>
</li>
<li>
<p> If you compose an operation with a layer-like object, that operation is applied
to the layer, returning a new layer-like object. The operation is applied to the
layer as a whole, not any sub-parts (e.g. sub-layers or graphical objects).
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Value</h3>

<p>An operation.
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">
library(ggplot2)

# composing operations together chains them
adjust(color = "red") |&gt; blend("multiply")

# unlike multiplication, composition does not follow the distributive law
mult_op = (adjust(aes(y = 11 -x), color = "skyblue") + 1) * blend("multiply")
mult_op

comp_op = (adjust(aes(y = 11 -x), color = "skyblue") + 1) |&gt; blend("multiply")
comp_op

# multiplication by a geom returns a modified version of that geom
data.frame(x = 1:10) |&gt;
  ggplot(aes(x = x, y = x)) +
  geom_line(linewidth = 10, color = "red") * comp_op

</code></pre>
