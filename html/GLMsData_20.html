<h2>Decayed, missing and filled teeth</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>The data give the estimates of the mean number of 
decayed, missing and filled teeth 
(<abbr><span class="acronym">DMFT</span></abbr>)
at age 12 years,
and the mean annual sugar consumption in the previous five years
for 90 countries
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre><code class="language-R">data(dental)</code></pre>


<h3>Format</h3>

<dd>
<p>the country;    
a factor</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Indus</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>whether the country is considered an industrialized country;
a factor with levels <code>Ind</code> (industrialized)
or <code>NonInd</code> (not industrialized)</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>Sugar</code></dt>
<dd>
<p>the mean annual sugar consumption 
in kilograms per person per year,
computed over the five years (or as much as available) 
prior to the survey; 
a numeric vector</p>
</dd>
<dt><code>DMFT</code></dt>
<dd>

<h3>Details</h3>

<p>The data give the estimates of the mean 
number of decayed, missing and filled teeth 
(<abbr><span class="acronym">DMFT</span></abbr>)
at age 12 years,
and the mean annual sugar consumption in the previous five years
for 90 countries.
For some countries,
data on sugar consumption was unavailable for the previous five years,
and the average was computed for the available data;
see Woodward and Walker (1994) for details.
