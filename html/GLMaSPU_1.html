An Adaptive Test on High Dimensional Parameters in Generalized Linear Models
</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Provide various tests on high-dimensional parameters in generalized linear models.
</p>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Several tests for high dimensional generalized linear models have been proposed recently. In this package, we implemented a new test called aSPU for high dimensional generalized linear models, which is often more powerful than the existing methods in a wide scenarios. We also implemented permutation based version of several existing methods for research purpose. We recommend users use the aSPU test for their real testing problem.
