<h2>Attempt faster method of copying packages across libraries in the future</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Groundhog often moves packages between the groundhog library and the default personal library.
This is done by renaming the package folders ('renaming' the parent directory of a folder, effectively moves it).
This process is nearly instantaneous  even for 100+ packages. The renaming method, however, is sometimes unavailable for some configurations
(e.g., when the groundhog and personal folders are on different drives/volumes, say external vs internal hard drives).  When
groundhog fails to move a package by renaming it, it will produce an error, and will also make a note to permanently switch to
the slower method of moving packages by first coping them, and then deleting the original, which takes up to a few seconds per package, and
is thus much slower than renaming. If you believe the error was circumstantial and want to give
renaming files another chance, you may run <code>try.renaming.method.again()</code>. Future groundhog.library() calls
will again attempt it. If it fails again you will just get a new error message and groundhog will again switch methods.
It is safe to err on the side of trying again, so unless you know you are using multiple physical drives, you probably should try again, and
investigate a possible alternative source of the problem. To debug, you may choose <code>cores=1</code> to force sequential installation,
<code>force.install=TRUE</code> to reinstall possibly poorly installed dependencies, and as always, inspecting the console log as packages get installed.
