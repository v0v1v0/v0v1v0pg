<h2>Example Genomic Simulation Pedigree, GSP, with 13 members</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>A GSP is a pedigree with no inbreeding which specifies
This is a relatively complex GSP.  The tibble <code>GSP</code> specifies its
structure using the following columns:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>ind</code>: the numeric identifier for the individual specific to the row
(we will call that the "focal individual").
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>par1</code>: numeric identifier of the first parent of the focal individual.
Must be NA for pedigree founders.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>par2</code>: numeric identifier of the second parent of the focal individual.
Must be NA for pedigree founders.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ipar1</code>: the number of gametes that will be incoming from the first parent
to the focal individual. Must be NA for pedigree founders. Note that this
must be equal to <code>ipar2</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>ipar2</code>: the number of gametes that will be incoming from the second parent
to the focal individual. Must be NA for pedigree founders. Note that this
must be equal to <code>ipar1</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>hap1</code>: character name for the first haplotype of a founder (if the focal
individual is a founder).  Must be NA for pedigree non-founders.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>hap2</code>: character name for the second haplotype of a founder (if the focal
individual is a founder).  Must be NA for pedigree non-founders.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>hpop1</code>: character ID of the population from which haplotype 1 comes from.
Must be NA for pedigree non-founders.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>hpop2</code>: character ID of the population from which haplotype 2 comes from.
Must be NA for pedigree non-founders.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>sample</code>: character ID for the sample from the focal individual. NA if no samples
are taken from the focal individual, and must be NA for any pedigree founders.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>osample</code>: numeric value giving the number or samples that are taken from this
individual.  <code>osample</code> must be less than or equal to <code>ipar1</code> and <code>ipar2</code>. If
<code>osample</code> is less than <code>ipar1</code> and <code>ipar2</code>, then some gametes must get passed
on to descendants of the focal individual.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
